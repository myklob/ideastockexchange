# Electronic Democracy

We aim to establish a political party that uses **open, transparent online platforms** (inspired by Wikipedia) to:

1. Organize and present **pro/con reasons** for each government policy.
2. Rank reasons by **evidence strength and performance**.
3. Score conclusions based on the **performance of supporting reasons**.
4. Include multiple cost/benefit dimensions:
   - Financial
   - Time
   - Freedom
   - Security
   - Autonomy
   - Risk
   - Health
5. Promote candidates who pledge to **use public forums** for transparent policy evaluation.

## How It Works

Each policy proposal will have two main columns:
- **Reasons to Agree**
- **Reasons to Disagree**

Reasons can include:
- **Costs & Benefits** (e.g., money, lives, man-hours, freedom, health).
- **Logical Arguments** (if–then logic, causality, strengthening arguments).
- **Scientific Studies** (ranked by rigor — sample size, randomization, blinding, controls, study setting).
- **Media References** (books, videos, speeches, poems, etc.).

Every argument gets:
- A **score** for its own merit.
- A **linkage score** when it’s used as evidence for another argument.
- A **unique score** to track originality.

**Example:**  
The belief *“Nazis committed genocide during WWII”* has its own score.  
If used to support *“We should go to war with Germany”* — and combined with *“We should violently oppose genocide”* — the linkage score applies.

## Using Media as Evidence

Arguments appear in many forms of media — books, films, songs, essays.  
Some media pieces cover a topic so fully that they should be evaluated as a whole.

We can:
1. List the most influential works for or against a conclusion.
2. Extract and score each argument within that work.
3. Average validity scores for the overall “pull” of the media.
4. Track **direction** (what conclusions it supports), **validity** (argument quality), and **influence** (sales, citations, cultural reach).

## Policy Analysis Algorithm

Like the U.S. Founding Fathers, we believe **well-designed systems** solve difficult problems.  
Our algorithm evaluates policies using:
- Cost–benefit analysis.
- Logical reasoning.
- Scientific evidence review.

This creates a **systematic framework** for identifying policies that maximize safety, happiness, and societal well-being.

---

## Pragmatic Democracy

Optimal policies are identified by **communities of informed, rational participants** who:
- Research thoroughly.
- Evaluate evidence.
- Minimize costs and risks while maximizing benefits.

The process is collaborative, evidence-based, and **pragmatic**.

---

## Balancing Conflicting Principles

Political debates often involve **competing values** (justice vs. mercy, liberty vs. security).  
Our party’s process:
- Uses **objective criteria** to determine when one principle should outweigh another.
- Avoids swinging between extremes by weighing both **costs and benefits**.

---

## Moving Beyond Political Dogma

Dogma (e.g., “big government is always bad”) limits problem-solving.  
Instead, we focus on **effective decision-making processes** that:
- Use evidence, transparency, and reason.
- Are adaptable to new data.
- Remove bias and corruption.

---

## Promoting Process-Based Politics

Political parties should **compete on process quality**, not ideology.  
Processes include:
- Separation of powers
- Scientific method
- Cost–benefit analysis
- Logical validation
- Bias removal
- Conflict resolution techniques
- Voting reform
- Transparency and deliberative democracy

The **goal**:  
Find solutions that work for the majority, park intractable issues peacefully, and leave participants more satisfied after debate.

---

## Why a Process-Based Approach?

Direct democracy on every decision is impractical.  
Instead:
- Allow citizens to **contribute as they can**.
- Use representatives and facilitators guided by **evidence-based processes**.
- Make policy development transparent and accountable.

Representative democracy is not the problem — **parties ignoring data is**.
