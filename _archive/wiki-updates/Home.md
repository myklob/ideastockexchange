# Welcome to the Idea Stock Exchange Wiki

We're building an open, evidence-based platform to **rank arguments, measure belief strength, and automate conflict resolution** — bringing structure to online debate.

## [ReasonRank: Google's PageRank for Arguments](https://github.com/myklob/ideastockexchange/wiki/ReasonRank:-Google's-PageRank-for-Arguments)
Google's PageRank can be adapted to assess the strength of pro/con arguments.
Just as PageRank values a site based on the quality of links, **ReasonRank values conclusions based on the strength of supporting arguments** — factoring in logic, evidence, and relevance.

---

## [Truth Score: Logical Fallacy + Evidence Verification](https://github.com/myklob/ideastockexchange/wiki/Truth-Score)
We integrate two powerful measures:
- **Logical Fallacy Score** — measures the degree and impact of fallacies in an argument.
- **Evidence Verification Score** — evaluates how well the claim is supported by independent, rigorous evidence.

Combined, these scores **quantify argument credibility** and encourage reasoning grounded in both logic and verifiable fact.

## [Linkage Scores: Connecting Evidence to Conclusions](https://github.com/myklob/ideastockexchange/wiki/Evidence-to-Conclusion-Relevance-Score)
Our system measures the **relevance and causal strength** between evidence, intermediate arguments, and final conclusions.
The method:
- Weighs each link in the reasoning chain.
- Uses an adapted PageRank model to reflect collective judgment on relevance.

---

## [Impact Algorithm: Argument Importance & Belief Impact Scores](https://github.com/myklob/ideastockexchange/wiki/Confidence-Stability-Scores)
- **Argument Importance Score** — measures how much a belief depends on a specific argument.
- **Belief Impact Score (BIS)** — combines argument strength with cost-benefit analysis to assess the real-world consequences of accepting a belief.

These scores help identify the **most influential arguments** and the beliefs that most affect society.

---

## [Redundancy Reduction: Discourse De-duplication](https://github.com/myklob/ideastockexchange/wiki/Better-Ways-of-Saying-the-Same-thing)
We group equivalent or highly similar arguments so debates stay **focused and concise**.
- **Equivalency Score** — calculated using semantic similarity + argument performance.
- Displays "better ways of saying the same thing" to reduce clutter.

---

## [Automated Conflict Resolution](https://github.com/myklob/ideastockexchange/wiki/Automated-Conflict-Resolution)
Our conflict-resolution engine:
- Focuses on **interests, not positions**.
- Evaluates solutions against **objective criteria**.
- Scores proposals on **resolution likelihood**, factoring in cost-benefit trade-offs and compromise requirements.

---

## [Belief Stability Confidence Score](https://github.com/myklob/ideastockexchange/wiki/Confidence-Stability-Scores)
Measures how stable a belief's score is over time based on:
- Depth of analysis.
- Unresolved sub-arguments.
- Stability across repeated evaluations.

A belief with **thousands of hours of stable analysis** carries more weight than one quickly assessed.

---

## The Vision
By combining **crowdsourced reasoning** with structured scoring systems, we aim to:
- Make arguments **searchable, comparable, and ranked**.
- Show the **strongest and weakest points** for any belief.
- Foster productive, respectful, evidence-based debate.

> **Join us** in building the internet's "truth infrastructure" — where better arguments rise, weaker ones fall, and decisions are made with clarity.
