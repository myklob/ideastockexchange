# How This Works: What You See When You Click Any Belief

**🔍 Understanding the Belief Web Interface**

Each belief on the Idea Stock Exchange is not just a sentence — it is a node in a larger [web of beliefs](Wikipedia%20for%20Debates). When you click on any belief, you are shown how it connects to all other beliefs through [linkage scores](Linkage%20Scores), [argument scores](Argument%20scores%20from%20sub-argument%20scores), and the overall [belief score](truth).

This page shows four things:

1. **All reasons to agree** with the belief, sorted by strength
2. **All reasons to disagree** with the belief, also sorted by strength
3. **All other beliefs this belief supports** (downstream links)
4. **All beliefs that support this belief** (upstream links)

## 1. Reasons to Agree and Disagree — Sorted by Strength

Every belief page contains two lists:

- **[Reasons to Agree](Reasons)**
- **[Reasons to Disagree](Reasons)**

These are not random lists. They are sorted by:

**Contribution Score = Linkage Score × Belief Score**

Where:

- [Linkage Score](Linkage%20Scores) measures how strongly the reason relates to this belief.
- [Belief Score](truth) measures the independent strength of the reason itself (based on all of its own pros/cons).

High-scoring reasons rise to the top automatically. Weak, low-quality, or poorly supported reasons sink to the bottom. This makes every belief page a ranked, evidence-weighted map of the most rational arguments available.

## 2. Upstream Beliefs — What This Belief Depends On

Every belief is supported by other beliefs. These appear under:

**"More General Beliefs That Support This"**

These show you *why* supporters believe the belief is true. They include moral principles, factual assumptions, foundational values, and broader claims. Clicking any of these takes you to a new belief page, where you see that belief's own reasons to agree and disagree.

This reveals the deeper structure of the argument — the assumptions and principles that hold the belief up.

---

## 3. Downstream Beliefs — What This Belief Leads To

Every belief is also used to support other, more specific claims. These appear under:

**"More Specific Beliefs That This Supports"**

This shows what conclusions depend on the belief being true. If the belief is rejected, these downstream conclusions lose support. If the belief is strengthened, the downstream conclusions become stronger.

This makes debate transparent: you can see how changing one belief affects many others.

## 4. The Web of Beliefs

Because every belief links both upward and downward, clicking through several belief pages shows you the full [web of beliefs](Wikipedia%20for%20Debates):

- which beliefs support each other
- which beliefs contradict each other
- where assumptions branch out into conclusions
- where many beliefs point to the same foundational issue
- which arguments are strong, which are weak, and why

This creates the opposite of normal debates (which go in circles). It becomes more like **Wikipedia + a mathematical scoring system + a living map of reasoning**.

## Why This Matters

This system solves the problem of debates being:

- repetitive
- factually chaotic
- endlessly circular

Instead, you get:

- a single page per belief
- the strongest arguments first
- transparent scoring
- automatic ranking of reasons
- a navigable structure of interconnected ideas

Every belief becomes a living reference page — like a scientific article with a debate engine built in.
