The Architecture of Reason: One Page Per Topic
The Core Belief: To cure the chaos of online discourse, we must create a single, unified page for every topic. This page must organize beliefs in three simultaneous dimensions—General to Specific, Weak to Strong, and Negative to Positive—allowing users to navigate complexity with the clarity of a map.
Parent Topics: Debate Reform; Collective Intelligence; Internet 3.0

The Problem: The Broken Debate
Right now, online discussions fail us in four critical ways:

Topic Drift: Conversations wander, losing focus and momentum.
Scattered Arguments: Brilliant insights vanish into endless, unsearchable comment threads.
Repetition Without Progress: We argue in circles, never building on what came before.
No Collective Memory: There is no record of what has been proven, disproven, or refined over time.
The cost? Lost insights, wasted energy, and debates that generate heat but no light.

The Solution: Multi-Dimensional Belief Mapping
We solve this by treating ideas not as a stream of text, but as data points in a 3D space. On the Idea Stock Exchange, every topic page allows you to sort the chaos into order using three specific axes.

Dimension 1: General → Specific (The Abstraction Ladder)
Navigate up to see the broader principles or down to explore specific policy implementations. This prevents "category errors" where people argue about specific laws when they actually disagree on fundamental philosophy.

Level	Belief Statement	Score
Most General	"Strong democratic institutions are essential for a stable society."	+78
↓	"Term limits improve the health of democratic institutions."	+45
↓	"Congressional term limits would reduce corruption."	+32
Most Specific	"A 12-year term limit for the U.S. Congress would reduce corporate lobbying influence."	+18
Dimension 2: Weak → Strong (The Confidence Scale)
Sort beliefs by intensity. Note that the strongest claims often have lower scores because they require a higher burden of proof. This dimension helps users distinguish between nuanced reality and dogmatic extremism.

Belief Statement	Intensity	Score
"Electric cars have some measurable environmental benefits."	20% (Modest)	+42
"Electric cars significantly reduce global carbon emissions."	60% (Strong)	+68
"Electric cars are the single essential solution for solving climate change."	100% (Absolute)	+35
Dimension 3: Negative → Positive (The Valence Spectrum)
View the full spectrum of positions in one view. Instead of a binary "Pro/Con," we map the nuance of the debate, allowing users to find the exact point where they stand.

Position	Belief Statement	Score
Strongly Negative	"Social media is the primary cause of modern mental health decline."	-75
Moderately Negative	"Social media has significant downsides that outweigh the positives."	-45
Neutral/Mixed	"Social media has an equal mix of benefits and costs."	0
Moderately Positive	"Social media enables valuable connections that improve life quality."	+38
Strongly Positive	"Social media is essential infrastructure for modern democracy."	+22
Putting It All Together: The Master View
When we combine these dimensions, we get a complete picture of a topic. All statements regarding a subject—regardless of their tone or intensity—are merged into one page.

Topic Example: "Donald Trump's Capability"

Hierarchy	Intensity	Valence	Statement	Score
General	Moderate	Negative	"Career politicians generally lack business intelligence."	-25
↓ Specific	Moderate	Negative	"Trump lacks the specific intellect required for the presidency."	-30
↓ Specific	Strong	Negative	"Trump is cognitively impaired."	-45
↓ Specific	Extreme	Negative	"Trump is the least intelligent president in history."	-52
Result: A single page where you can find the best argument for the position you hold, or challenge yourself with the best argument for the opposing view.

How It Works: The Engine Under the Hood
1. Structure That Scales
Topic Hubs: Each major question gets its own hub where all perspectives converge.
Belief Subpages: Every specific claim gets dedicated space with organized arguments and evidence.
Side-by-Side Layout: Competing viewpoints appear together for direct comparison, preventing echo chambers.
2. Intelligence That Learns
Dynamic Scoring: Arguments rise and fall based on truth, evidence quality, and logical strength.
Linkage Scores: We don't just ask if a fact is true; we ask if it actually supports the conclusion.
Semantic Grouping: Duplicate arguments are merged automatically, keeping discussions clean.
3. Real-World Application
Cost-Benefit Integration: Evaluate real-world impacts alongside logical validity.
Stakeholder Analysis: See who benefits, who pays, and what values drive each position.
The Vision
By giving every topic its own "room" where ideas can be organized across multiple dimensions, we create the infrastructure for collective intelligence. This isn't just better debate—it's a foundation for evidence-based governance, systematic conflict resolution, and decisions that actually serve the common good.

Ideas are tested, not just shouted. Evidence is gathered, not ignored. Progress is measured, not assumed.

This is how democracy evolves. This is how we move from tribal warfare to collaborative wisdom.
