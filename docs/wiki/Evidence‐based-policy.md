# Evidence-Based Policy

**Evidence-based policy** is the practice of grounding policy decisions in rigorously established, objective evidence rather than ideology, “common sense,” anecdotes, or personal intuition.

The **Idea Stock Exchange** aims to promote evidence-based policy by providing a transparent, quantifiable, and dynamic framework for evaluating policy proposals.

## 1. Core Contributions to Evidence-Based Policy

### **1.1 Structured Database of Conclusions and Assumptions**
- Maps **how conclusions relate** to other conclusions and to their underlying assumptions.
- Quantifies the strength of these links.
- Prioritizes policies supported by **strong, interconnected assumptions** and **well-reasoned conclusions**.

---

### **1.2 Scoring System for Arguments**
- Each conclusion’s score is determined by:
  - **Strength of supporting/opposing arguments**
  - **Linkage scores** (relevance between evidence and conclusion)
  - **Uniqueness scores** (avoiding double-counting similar arguments)
- Ensures that **well-supported policies** gain visibility and credibility.

---

### **1.3 Automatic Score Updates**
- Scores dynamically **recalculate** when related assumptions are strengthened or weakened.
- Keeps results aligned with **current, most reliable evidence**.
- Prevents outdated data from influencing decision-making.

---

### **1.4 Facilitating Evidence-Based Discussions**
- A hub for **fact-driven debate**.
- Allows policymakers, researchers, and the public to:
  - Share evidence
  - Challenge assumptions
  - Collaboratively refine policy proposals

---

### **1.5 Transparency and Accessibility**
- The database and scoring system are **open to public review**.
- Transparent methodology allows **scrutiny, replication, and validation**.
- Builds **trust** in the policy-making process.

## 2. Why This Matters
Evidence-based policy improves:
- **Decision quality** – grounded in measurable facts
- **Public trust** – via open and transparent evaluation
- **Adaptability** – policies evolve as evidence changes

---

## 3. Summary
The Idea Stock Exchange supports evidence-based policy by:
1. Structuring and linking conclusions to assumptions
2. Scoring arguments with quantitative metrics
3. Automatically updating scores as new evidence emerges
4. Enabling collaborative, fact-driven discussions
5. Ensuring transparency and accessibility

By embedding these principles into the platform, policy decisions can become **more informed, less partisan, and better aligned with real-world evidence**.
