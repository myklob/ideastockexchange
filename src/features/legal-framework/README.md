# Legal Framework Feature (wikiLaw)

Diagnostic analysis of laws and policies. Every law is treated as a **bet on reality** that can be tested, argued about, and improved.

## What This Module Does

- Renders law diagnostic dashboards: plain-English decode, stated vs. operative purpose, evidence audits, justification stress-tests, stakeholder ledgers, and implementation trackers.
- Manages example law data with structured analysis.
- Houses law-specific UI components (assumption cards, evidence cards, diagnostic sections).

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Operating Assumptions** | Beliefs about reality that a law depends on to function as intended. |
| **Purpose Gap** | Difference between what a law claims to do and the incentives it actually creates. |
| **Evidence Audit** | Pro/con effectiveness arguments, real-world examples, and unintended consequences. |
| **Stakeholder Ledger** | Who pays, who benefits, and who is a silent victim of second-order effects. |
