When you submit a reason to disagree you are submitting a new Thesis: that the original thesis had one of the following logical fallacies:
  1. Fallacy of Accident or [Sweeping Generalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_(fallacy))
  1. [Converse Fallacy of Accident or Hasty Generalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_accident)
  1. [Irrelevant Conclusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoratio_elenchi)
  1. [Affirming the Consequent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent)
  1. [Denying the antecedent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denying_the_antecedent)
  1. [Begging the question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question)
  1. [Fallacy of False Cause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_(logic))
  1. [Fallacy of many questions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_many_questions)
  1. [Straw man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)

Once you do this people will be able to vote if they agree or disagree, post reasons to agree and disagree, etc.

## Interest algorithm ##

There are two scores associated with interest:
  1. The percentage of people who agree that an interest can be ascribed to people who agree or disagree with a conclusion.
  1. The percentage of people who agree that an interest is valid.

For instance in a conflict between Palestinians and Israelis their are many interest or motivations of the disputing parties. Both sides of the conflict can be said to have an interest in revenge, and also a desire for a home land. Both would rank high as being considered an interest of the disputing side, however revenge would be considered to not be a valid interest.

We would add the two numbers, and divide by two. So if 98% of people agreed that the desire for a homeland could be ascribed as an interest of both parties, and 80% of people consider it to be a valid interest, it would result in a score of 89%



#summary Submit a reason to Agree.

## Why brainstorm reasons to agree and disagree? ##

We have access to more information that one person could ever learn. The quantity of information puts even more importance of organizing data. This involves mapping data into their relationship with conclusions.

In order for others to understand the conclusions we come to others have to understand our values, our assumptions, our dataset that we accept as valid, etc.

We should brainstorm reasons to agree and disagree with important conclusions. If we can map DNA we should be able to map arguments for and against different conclusions. It is cruel to have thousands of years of written history, hundreds of thousands of books, but no way to synthesize information, and put it all together.

Putting reasons to agree and disagree on the same page is more likely to result in informed conclusions.

It is important that citizens come to informed conclusions.

"There can be no more constructive approach to a controversial issue than to have each side present the evidence which it finds most convincing, always bearing in mind that authority is not evidence and that name-dropping is as futile as name-calling."

"Sweeping statements and general impressions are sometimes useful in the process of getting one's bearings and thinking up a position, but they cannot serve as evidence" because they are expressions of personal impressions which would take a lot of work to outline.

## Explanation: ##

In formal logic, a reason to agree is a premise. For instance in the following statement:
> "Since all men are mortal and Socrates is a man, it follows that Socrates is mortal"

There are two premises:
  1. All men are mortal
  1. Socrates is a man

Sacrates is a mortal, is the conclusion or thesis.
