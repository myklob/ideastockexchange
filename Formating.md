# We should create forums with one belief per page #

To agree:
  1. You can't make any progress in a debate when people keep changing the topic.
  1. Wikipedia has done well because they have one page dedicated to a single topic.
  1. There is too much duplication of debates on the internet.
  1. When you have a normal debate someone says something something, lets call it thesis A. Someone will give a reason to disagree, lets call it RTDwA (reasons to disagree with A). Then the other person may give a reasons to disagree with the reasons to disagree with A RTDwRTDwA. So with only 3 statements, the conversation topic has changed 3 times. No one can keep track of all of this in their brain and so this is why discussions are so repetitive and never accomplish anything. What typically happens is tortuous twisty sub-discussions, with he original topic being forgotten completely.
  1. If we had one page devoted to a topic, it would be easier for search engines, and people to continually reference the definitive place for outline of all possible discussions on a particular topic.
  1. If we devoted one page per belief, instead of basing things on a chronological debate that happened in real time, we could organize all possible debates in all time on that subject with all possible routes, so that any time someone brings up a new argument as a reason to agree or disagree with a particular conclusion, those arguments would be thoroughly investigated by their logical offshoots, not just whatever offshoot the persons talking decide to choose.
  1. It works well with Wikipedia.
  1. Discussion forums are not popular or influential. No one references an online discussion forum that uses thread type back and forth discussions. Those are all just wasts of time, and places for people to vent, but don't actually convince anyone of anything.

It would be cool to have [reasons to agree and disagree on the same page](reasonstoagreeanddisagreeonthesamepage.md).

  1. In order to win an argument you need to address your opponents criticisms.
  1. It doesn't prove anything if you make a good argument, and you only allow facts that support your conclusion onto your page.
  1. "No concept man forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction into the sum of his knowledge."
  1. "There can be no more constructive approach to a controversial issue than to have each side present the evidence which it finds most convincing, always bearing in mind that authority is not evidence and that name-dropping is as futile as name-calling."
  1. "Sweeping statements and general impressions are sometimes useful in the process of getting one's bearings and thinking up a position, but they cannot serve as evidence because they are expressions of personal impressions which are non-transferable."
