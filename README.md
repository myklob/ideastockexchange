# Idea Stock Exchange: Automating Conflict Resolution and Cost-Benefit Analysis

Enhanced Conclusion Evaluation Algorithm

In today's world, we are overwhelmed by an abundance of data, information, and diverse arguments. Given the intricate nature of the challenges we encounter, it's crucial to utilize big data effectively for more informed decision-making.

Our goal is to develop a comprehensive database. This database will intricately map the interconnections between various conclusions and the impact of different assumptions on these conclusions. By establishing this system, we can assign scores to conclusions, which are derived from the collective scores of their underlying assumptions. This integration means that when an assumption's strength changes, the scores of all related conclusions will be automatically updated through computational processes.

This innovative approach will enable us to leverage the vast information available to us, steering towards a more informed and better world.

I suggest the creation of database tools that will operationalize the following formula for evaluating conclusions:

Score of a Specific Conclusion = Σ [(Score of Supporting Arguments - Score of Opposing Arguments) × Relevance Score × Distinctiveness Score]


# Objective Debate Evaluation System (ODES)

## Overview
Objective Debate Evaluation System (ODES) is an innovative scoring formula designed to transform the way debates are evaluated. By quantitatively assessing the strength of evidence and its linkage to debate conclusions, ODES introduces a new level of objectivity and precision in debate analysis.

## Features
- **Objective Scoring Formula**: Calculates the Conclusion Score (CS) based on logical, evidence-backed metrics.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation Criteria**: Factors in reasons to agree/disagree, evidence strength, logical validity, verification, linkage, uniqueness, and importance.
- **ReasonRank Algorithm**: An adaptation of the Google PageRank algorithm, tailored for debate scoring, to rank and weigh arguments effectively.

Conclusion Score (CS) = ∑ (Reasons to Agree (RtA) - Reasons to Disagree (RtD)) × (Evidence Assessment for Agreement (EA) - Evidence Assessment for Disagreement (ED)) × Logical Validity (LV) × Verification (V) × Linkage (L) × Uniqueness (U) × Importance (I)

This formula encapsulates:

* CS (Conclusion Score): The final score assigned to a conclusion.
* RtA/RtD: The balance of arguments supporting or opposing the conclusion.
* EA/ED: The quality of evidence for or against the conclusion.
* LV: The logical consistency of the conclusion.
* V: The degree to which the conclusion has been confirmed.
* L: How strongly the conclusion is connected to other relevant conclusions.
* U: The distinctiveness of the conclusion from similar arguments.
* I: The overall significance of the conclusion in a broader context.

## Getting Started
To get started with ODES, clone this repository and follow the setup instructions in the [installation guide](/INSTALL.md).
