# Idea Stock Exchange: Advancing Automated Conflict Resolution and Cost-Benefit Analysis

The **Idea Stock Exchange** is an innovative platform designed to facilitate **automated conflict resolution and cost-benefit analysis**. At its core is the **Conclusion Score (CS)**, a metric that quantitatively evaluates the strength and validity of conclusions or beliefs by analyzing arguments and evidence.

## Conclusion Score (CS)

The **Conclusion Score (CS)** is calculated based on multiple factors, ensuring a **balanced, evidence-based deliberation process**. Each belief or argument is scored dynamically, reflecting the strength of its supporting and opposing components.

### **Component Summary**

| Component                      | Abbreviation | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reasons to Agree/Disagree      | RtA/RtD      | Strength and number of arguments supporting or opposing a conclusion.     |
| Evidence Strength              | ES           | Evaluates the reliability and relevance of supporting/disputing evidence. |
| Logical Coherence              | LC           | Assesses logical structuring and the absence of fallacies in arguments.   |
| Verification and Credibility   | VC           | Measures evidence credibility based on unbiased, independent sources.     |
| Linkage and Relevance          | LR           | Evaluates the argument's direct influence on the conclusion.              |
| Uniqueness and Distinctiveness | UD           | Recognizes originality, reducing redundancy in argumentation.             |
| Argument Importance            | AI           | Weighs the significance of an argument's impact on the conclusion.        |

### **Formula for Conclusion Score**

```
CS = ∑((RtA - RtD) × ES × LC × VC × LR × UD × AI)
```

This **algorithmic approach** ensures that well-supported, logically coherent, and unique arguments receive higher scores, promoting **informed decision-making**.

### **Example Calculation**

Assessing a policy’s **CS** with:
- **RtA**: Scores of 4 and 3
- **RtD**: Score of 2
- **ES, LC, VC, LR, UD, AI**: Average weighted values of **0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 0.85, 0.9, and 0.95** respectively

```
CS = ((4 + 3 - 2) × 0.8 × 0.9 × 1.0 × 0.85 × 0.9 × 0.95)
```

This approach systematically evaluates all arguments in the **Idea Stock Exchange** to promote **evidence-based conclusions**.

## **The Role of ReasonRank**

Every belief and argument undergoes **ReasonRank analysis**, an adapted version of Google’s **PageRank algorithm**. This assigns scores based on the performance of **pro/con sub-arguments**, ensuring a **self-correcting** and **adaptive** framework where:

- Arguments are **linked dynamically** across different debates.
- The **importance of evidence vs. reasoning** is continuously updated based on **meta-arguments** about truth evaluation.

---

## **Development Roadmap**

The **Idea Stock Exchange** is under active development. Below are key steps in its implementation:

### **1. Prototype Completion**

- Develop the **Logical Fallacy and Evidence Verification** algorithms.
- Design a **user-friendly interface** for argument interaction.
- Integrate the **database, user interface, and algorithms** into a single system.

### **2. First Testing Phase**

- Conduct **unit and integration testing** to ensure functionality.
- Implement **bug tracking** and **security assessments**.
- Validate the **performance and usability** of key features.

### **3. Feedback Review & Refinement**

- Collect feedback from **early adopters and testers**.
- Prioritize **enhancements** based on impact and feasibility.
- Refine the **algorithm and data analysis capabilities**.

### **4. Version 1.0 Launch**

- Deploy the platform publicly and set up **user support systems**.
- Implement **real-time monitoring** for immediate issue resolution.
- Continue iterating based on **user experience and feedback**.

## **ArgumentRank Algorithm**

Below is a modified **PageRank algorithm** adapted to rank arguments based on **supporting and opposing evidence**:

```python
=======
# ReasonRank: 
ReasonRank: An adaptation of Google's PageRank to evaluate reasons based on the number and relative strength of pro/con reasons, factoring in the number of pro/con sub-arguments, similar to how Google ranks pages based on the number of links and the strength of those links determined by their sub-links.
````python
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
import numpy as np

def argumentrank(M, num_iterations: int = 100, d: float = 0.85):
    """ArgumentRank algorithm to evaluate the credibility of arguments based on interlinking support."""
    N = M.shape[1]
    v = np.ones(N) / N
    M_hat = d * M + (1 - d) / N
    for i in range(num_iterations):
        v = np.dot(M_hat, v)
        v = np.maximum(v, 0)  # Prevent negative scores
        v /= v.sum()  # Normalize to sum to 1
    return v

# Example argument linkage matrix
M = np.array([[0, -0.5, 0, 0, 1],
              [0.5, 0, -0.5, 0, 0],
              [0.5, -0.5, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 1, 0.5, 0, -1],
              [0, 0, 0.5, 1, 0]])

v = argumentrank(M, 100, 0.85)
print(v)
```

This algorithm ensures that **valid, well-supported arguments rise in credibility** while **weaker arguments diminish over time**.
