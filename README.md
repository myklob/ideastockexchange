# Idea Stock Exchange: Automating Conflict Resolution and Cost-Benefit Analysis

The Conclusion Score (CS) in the context of the Idea Stock Exchange and its automated conflict resolution system is a metric designed to quantitatively assess the strength and validity of a particular conclusion or belief. This score is derived from a comprehensive evaluation process that considers various aspects of the arguments and evidence supporting or opposing the conclusion. Here's a breakdown of its components based on the information from your documents:

**Reasons to Agree/Disagree (RtA/RtD):** These metrics quantify the persuasive power of arguments in favor of or against a conclusion. They include the number and strength of such arguments.

**Evidence Assessment (EA/ED):** This involves evaluating the solidity and relevance of evidence that reinforces or detracts from an argument. It considers the quality and directness of the evidence in relation to the conclusion.

**Logical Validity (LV):** This aspect assesses whether an argument is logically coherent and free from fallacies. It is determined through debate outcomes and user responses, specifically focusing on identifying and accounting for any logical fallacies.

**Verification (V):** indicates how impartial and independent sources corroborate evidence. The score for verification is derived from how well each argument’s evidence is verified and supported.

**Linkage (L):** This multiplier assesses the direct connection and impact of the argument on the conclusion based on how relevant and integral the argument is to the decision.

**Uniqueness (U):** This recognizes the distinctiveness of arguments, rewarding originality and reducing redundancy. It involves identifying similar statements and determining a unique argument score when presented in support of the same conclusion.

**Importance (I):** This measures the significance of the argument and the potential ramifications if the claim is assumed true. The weight of an argument in terms of its importance is determined through debate over its relative importance.

The Conclusion Score (CS) is calculated using the formula:
# CS=∑((RtA−RtD)×(EA−ED)×LV×V×L×U×I)

Each element is critical in determining a conclusion's overall strength and credibility. The scoring system is designed to be objective and comprehensive. It incorporates many factors to evaluate conclusions based on the strength and quality of their supporting and opposing arguments and evidence​​.

Each item uses ReasonRank to create a score based on the performance of pro/con sub-arguments. Of course, these sub-arguments also have their own reason rank score. 

Here's Python script where the PageRank algorithm is modified to reflect an "ArgumentRank" approach. This modification adds the scores of supporting arguments and evidence and subtracts the scores of weakening arguments and evidence:

```python
import numpy as np

def argumentrank(M, num_iterations: int = 100, d: float = 0.85):
    """ArgumentRank algorithm with explicit number of iterations. Returns ranking of nodes (arguments) in the adjacency matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    M : numpy array
        adjacency matrix where M_i,j represents the link from 'j' to 'i', such that for all 'j'
        sum(i, M_i,j) != 0 (due to adding and subtracting)
    num_iterations : int, optional
        number of iterations, by default 100
    d : float, optional
        damping factor, by default 0.85

    Returns
    -------
    numpy array
        a vector of ranks such that v_i is the i-th rank,
        v sums may not equal 1 due to addition and subtraction of arguments

    """
    N = M.shape[1]
    v = np.ones(N) / N
    M_hat = d * M + (1 - d) / N
    for i in range(num_iterations):
        v = np.dot(M_hat, v)
        # Adjustments to ensure scores are not negative and sum to 1 after each iteration
        v = np.maximum(v, 0)
        v /= v.sum()
    return v

# Example adjacency matrix for argument links
M = np.array([[0, -0.5, 0, 0, 1],
              [0.5, 0, -0.5, 0, 0],
              [0.5, -0.5, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 1, 0.5, 0, -1],
              [0, 0, 0.5, 1, 0]])

v = argumentrank(M, 100, 0.85)
print(v)
```

This edited script represents an "ArgumentRank" algorithm where the adjacency matrix `M` now accounts for both strengthening and weakening arguments. The matrix entries are adjusted to add scores for supporting arguments and subtract scores for weakening arguments. Additionally, after each iteration, the algorithm ensures that the scores are normalized (non-negative and sum to 1) to maintain a consistent ranking system.
