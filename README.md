Traditional web search results rely on Google's PageRank algorithm, which measures the number of links to a website to determine its quality. However, this method can be manipulated and influenced by propaganda. ReasonRank, an adaptation of Google's PageRank Algorithm, addresses these limitations by evaluating the strength and validity of individual arguments within a pro/con forum.

ReasonRank adjusts the algorithm to count both the quantity and quality of reasons to agree or disagree, along with their corresponding sub-arguments. This allows for more persuasive arguments to be assigned greater importance, similar to how PageRank assesses the quality of links by the number and quality of links to their sub-links.

We can use ReasonRank to evaluate specialized pro-con arguments that address whether an argument would necessarily strengthen or weaken the conclusion, as well as if an argument is verified, logically sound, or significant.

Using ReasonRank in a pro/con forum would be an effective way to evaluate the strength and impact of individual arguments, ensuring evaluations are objective, transparent, and reliable. To further enhance the process, user feedback (votes) can be incorporated to refine the scores over time and ensure the strongest arguments rise to the top.

ReasonRank, in combination with user feedback and open discussion, has the potential to revolutionize the way we evaluate arguments and make decisions.

# Variables Need to Program Reason Rank: 
The reason_rank function takes a number of arguments, including:

Below are a list of variables:
1. M (M_pro and M_con): The adjacency matrix for arguments where M[i, j] represents the link from argument j to argument i for pro and con arguments, respectively. The adjacency matrix is a fundamental concept in graph theory, which is also used in Google's PageRank algorithm.
2. M_linkage_Pro and M_Linkage_Con: The adjacency matrices for argument-to-conclusion linkage, where M_linkage_Pro[i, j] and M_linkage_Con[i, j] represent the link from linkage argument j to pro or con argument i, respectively.  These matrices help determine how strongly each argument is connected to the overall conclusion.
3. uniqueness_scores_Pro and uniqueness_Scores_con: A vector containing the uniqueness scores for arguments.
4. initial_scores_Pro and initial_scores_con: A vector containing the initial scores for arguments.
5. num_iterations: The number of iterations for the algorithm to run (default is 100, but we can have a separate pro/con argument that it should be different and track its score).
6. d: The damping factor, a float value between 0 and 1 (default is 0.85).
7. N: The number of main arguments (separate for pro and con arguments).
8. v: A vector containing the argument scores at a specific iteration (separate for pro, con, and linkage arguments).
9. M_hat: The modified adjacency matrix for arguments, which includes the damping factor (separate for pro, con, and linkage arguments).
10. adjusted_v: The final adjusted argument scores, considering the linkage and uniqueness scores (separate for pro and con arguments).

# Explanation

Variable Development

The function starts by calculating the modified adjacency matrices, M_hat_pro and M_hat_con, which are used to compute the scores of the arguments at each iteration of the algorithm. The modified adjacency matrices are calculated using the following formula:
M_hat = d * M + (1 - d) / N * I

where:

* M is the adjacency matrix.
* d is the damping factor.
* N is the number of arguments.
* I is the identity matrix.

The function then iterates for the specified number of iterations, num_iterations. At each iteration, the scores of the arguments are updated as follows:
v = M_hat @ v

where:
* v is the vector of argument scores.
* M_hat is the modified adjacency matrix.

Finally, the function returns the adjusted argument scores, calculated as:

adjusted_v = v * uniqueness_scores * v_linkage

where:
adjusted_v is the vector of adjusted argument scores.

v is the vector of argument scores.

uniqueness_scores is a vector containing the uniqueness scores for arguments.

v_linkage is a vector containing the linkage scores for arguments.

The example usage shows how to use the reason_rank function to calculate the adjusted argument scores for a set of pro and con arguments. The example code uses the following data:

M_pro = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])
M_con = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])
M_linkage_pro = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])
M_linkage_con = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])
uniqueness_scores_pro = np.array([1, 1])
uniqueness_scores_con = np.array([1, 1])
initial_scores_pro = np.array([1, 1])
initial_scores_con = np.array([1, 1])

The output of the example code is:
Adjusted Pro Argument Scores: [1.0, 1.0]
Adjusted Con Argument Scores: [1.0, 1.0]



Recognizing fallacious arguments is crucial for developing a forum for better group decision-making, creating an evidence-based political party, and for humans to make intelligent group decisions.

To achieve this, we propose using the scientific method of tying the strength of our beliefs to the strength of the evidence. The evidence takes the form of pro/con arguments for human arguments. These arguments are tied to data with logic. Therefore, we will explicitly tie the strength of our belief to the power, or score, of the pro/con evidence.

We will measure the relative performance of pro/con sub-arguments by weighing each argument using a specific logical fallacy. Once a user flags an argument as using a logical fallacy, or if the computer uses semantic equivalency scores to flag an idea as being similar to another idea that has been identified as using a logical fallacy, the site will create a dedicated space for reasons to agree or disagree with the fallacy accusation. The logical fallacy score reflects the relative performance of these accusation arguments, and our argument analysis algorithms will subject these arguments to grouping similar ways of saying the same thing, ranking the different types of truth separate from importance, and linkage (evidence to conclusion linkage).

There are several common types of fallacious arguments that are often used to support conclusions, but they are actually non-sequiturs, meaning they do not logically follow from the premises. Examples of these types of arguments include:
* Ad hominem fallacy: This is when someone attacks the person making an argument rather than addressing the argument itself. For example, saying, "You can't trust anything he says because he's a convicted criminal," does not logically address the argument.
* Appeal to authority fallacy: This is when someone claims something is true simply because an authority figure says it is true without providing any other evidence or reasoning. For example, saying, "Dr. Smith said it, so it must be true," does not logically prove that the argument is sound.
* Red herring fallacy: This is when someone introduces a completely unrelated topic or argument to distract from the original argument. For example, saying, "I know I made a mistake, but what about all the good things I've done for the company?" does not logically address the issue.
* False cause fallacy: This is when someone claims that because one event happened before another, it must have caused the second event. For example, saying, "I wore my lucky socks, and then we won the game, so my socks must have caused the win," does not logically prove causation.

By identifying and avoiding these fallacies, individuals can contribute to a more rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, which can ultimately lead to a more effective political system and better-informed public opinion. The Logical Fallacy Score allows for the identification of specific fallacious arguments and promotes critical thinking and reasoned discourse.

## Algorithm
1. Identify a list of common logical fallacies.
2. Allow users to flag arguments that may contain these logical fallacies.
3. Enable users to share evidence and reasoning to support or weaken the belief that the argument identified in step #2 contains a logical fallacy. 
4. Develop a system to automatically flag arguments that are similar to other statements already flagged as containing a logical fallacy.
5. Create a machine learning algorithm to detect language patterns that may indicate a particular fallacy.
6. For each argument flagged as containing a logical fallacy, evaluate the score of logical fallacy sub-arguments that support or weaken the belief that the argument contains a logical fallacy. 
7. Use the results of these evaluations to assign a Logical Fallacy Score confidence interval.

It's important to note that the Logical Fallacy Score is just one of many algorithms used to evaluate each argument. We will also use other algorithms to determine the strength of the evidence supporting each argument, the equivalency of similar arguments, and more. The Logical Fallacy Score is designed to identify arguments that contain logical fallacies, which can weaken their overall credibility. By assessing the score of sub-arguments that contain fallacies, we can better evaluate the strength of an argument and make more informed decisions based on the evidence presented.

## Code
```Python
# Define a list of common logical fallacies
logical_fallacies = ['ad hominem', 'appeal to authority', 'red herring', 'false cause']

# Define a dictionary to store arguments and their logical fallacy scores
argument_scores = {}

# Define a function to evaluate the score of a sub-argument for a given logical fallacy
def evaluate_sub_argument_score(argument, fallacy):
    # Implement your algorithm for evaluating the score of a sub-argument for a given logical fallacy
    # ...
    # Return the score of the sub-argument for the given logical fallacy
    return score

# Define a function to evaluate the logical fallacy score for an argument
def evaluate_argument_score(argument):
    # Initialize the logical fallacy score to 0
    score = 0
    
    # Iterate over each logical fallacy
    for fallacy in logical_fallacies:
        # Evaluate the score of the sub-argument for the given logical fallacy
        sub_argument_score = evaluate_sub_argument_score(argument, fallacy)
        
        # Add the score of the sub-argument for the given logical fallacy to the logical fallacy score
        score += sub_argument_score
    
    # Return the logical fallacy score for the argument
    return score

# Allow users to flag arguments that may contain logical fallacies
flagged_arguments = []

# Enable users to share evidence and reasoning to support or weaken the belief that the argument contains a logical fallacy
argument_evidence = {}

# Develop a system to automatically flag arguments that are similar to other statements already flagged as containing a logical fallacy
similar_arguments = {}

# Create a machine learning algorithm to detect language patterns that may indicate a particular fallacy
fallacy_detector = YourFallacyDetector()

# Evaluate the logical fallacy score for each argument flagged as containing a logical fallacy
for argument in flagged_arguments:
    # Evaluate the logical fallacy score for the argument
    argument_score = evaluate_argument_score(argument)
    
    # Assign the logical fallacy score confidence interval for the argument
    if argument_score < -2:
        confidence_interval = "Very likely fallacious"
    elif argument_score < 0:
        confidence_interval = "Possibly fallacious"
    elif argument_score == 0:
        confidence_interval = "No indication of fallacy"
    elif argument_score < 2:
        confidence_interval = "Possibly sound"
    else:
        confidence_interval = "Very likely sound"
    
    # Store the argument and its logical fallacy score
    argument_scores[argument] = {'score': argument_score, 'confidence_interval': confidence_interval}
```

Here is code for YourFallacyDetector: 

```Python
import re

class YourFallacyDetector:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.fallacies = {
            'ad hominem': ['ad hominem', 'personal attack', 'poisoning the well'],
            'appeal to authority': ['appeal to authority', 'argument from authority'],
            'red herring': ['red herring', 'diversion', 'smoke screen'],
            'false cause': ['false cause', 'post hoc ergo propter hoc', 'correlation vs causation']
        }
        
        self.patterns = {}
        for fallacy, keywords in self.fallacies.items():
            self.patterns[fallacy] = re.compile(r'\b(?:%s)\b' % '|'.join(keywords), re.IGNORECASE)
    
    def detect_fallacy(self, text):
        results = {}
        for fallacy, pattern in self.patterns.items():
            match = pattern.search(text)
            if match:
                results[fallacy] = match.group()
        return results
```

With this code, you can call the detect_fallacy method on any piece of text and it will return a dictionary of detected fallacies and the specific keyword that triggered the detection. For example:

```scss
detector = YourFallacyDetector()

text = "You can't trust anything he says because he's a convicted criminal."
results = detector.detect_fallacy(text)
print(results)  # {'ad hominem': 'convicted criminal'}

text = "Dr. Smith said it, so it must be true."
results = detector.detect_fallacy(text)
print(results)  # {'appeal to authority': 'Dr. Smith'}

text = "I know I made a mistake, but what about all the good things I've done for the company?"
results = detector.detect_fallacy(text)
print(results)  # {'red herring': 'what about all the good things I\'ve done for the company'}

text = "I wore my lucky socks, and then we won the game, so my socks must have caused the win."
results = detector.detect_fallacy(text)
print(results)  # {'false cause': 'my socks'}
```

## Path Forward
1. A large and diverse dataset: To train the machine learning models used in the system, it would be helpful to have a large and diverse dataset of examples of logical fallacies. This dataset would ideally include examples from a wide range of domains (e.g., politics, business, science) and from different types of media (e.g., news articles, social media posts, speeches).

2. Domain-specific knowledge: Some types of logical fallacies may be more common in certain domains than others. For example, ad hominem attacks may be more common in political discourse than in scientific research. To improve the accuracy of the system, it would be helpful to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the algorithms.

3. Human input and feedback: While machine learning algorithms can be very effective at detecting patterns in large datasets, they may still make mistakes or miss certain nuances. To address this, the system could incorporate human input and feedback. For example, users could flag examples of logical fallacies that the system missed, or provide feedback on examples that were flagged incorrectly.

4. Continual improvement: Like any machine learning system, the logical fallacy detection system would benefit from continual improvement over time. This could involve collecting new data, refining the algorithms, and incorporating feedback from users. As the system improves, it could become more accurate and effective at identifying logical fallacies, which could ultimately lead to better decision-making and more informed public discourse.

The Evidence to Conclusion Linkage Score (ECLS) is a score that measures the logical connections between arguments and indicates the degree to which an argument would strengthen or weaken the central belief if it were assumed to be true. We use ECLS to determine how many points arguments should give each other and to avoid the false cause logical fallacy.

To calculate the ECLS between arguments A and B, we use the following formula:

ECLS(A, B) = (Σ strength of reasons to agree with the linkage between A and B) / (Σ total strength of arguments, agree and disagree)

The ECLS score can range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that there are no reasons to agree with the linkage between A and B, and 1 indicates that there are no reasons to disagree with the linkage between A and B.

Using ECLS enables us to connect our ideas and avoid non-sequiturs. Simple logic demands that we automatically weaken our conclusions when their assumptions are weakened. Therefore, ECLS scores are necessary to achieve group sanity and rational decision-making.

## Algorithm
1. Given a list of beliefs, allow users to identify potential reasons to agree or disagree with each other.
2. Assign a unique ID to each identified linkage between beliefs (e.g., Belief A as a reason to support Belief B and Belief D as a potential reason to oppose F).
3. Use user-generated arguments to calculate the strength of reasons to agree and disagree with each identified linkage.
4. Calculate the Evidence to Conclusion Linkage Score (ECLS) using the formula: ECLS(A, B) = (Σ strength of reasons to agree with the linkage between A and B) / (Σ total strength of arguments, agree and disagree).
5. Store the ECLS for each linkage in a table.
6. Multiply each argument's score by its corresponding ECLS to determine its contribution to the total conclusion score.
7. Sum the scores for all arguments supporting or opposing the conclusion to determine the final conclusion score.
8. Given a list of beliefs, allow them to be tagged as potential reasons to agree or disagree with each other. 
9. Assign a unique ID to each possible linkage.
10. For each potential linkage, users can post reasons to support or oppose the linkage. These arguments will either be tagged as a "strengthener" or "weakener" of the conclusion.
11. Use the performance of these pro/con reasons to calculate the linkage strength. Specifically, calculate the strength of reasons to agree with the linkage, the strength of reasons to disagree with the linkage, and then the total strength of both arguments.
12. Calculate the Evidence to Conclusion Linkage Score (ECLS) using the formula: ECLS(A, B) = (Σ strength of reasons to agree with the linkage between A and B) / (Σ total strength of arguments, agree and disagree). Store the ECLS in a table for each argument.
13. Each belief score will eventually be multiplied by its Belief to Conclusion Linkage Score.
14. The final conclusion score will be the product of each supporting and weakening belief score, multiplied by their individual scores as valid reasons to support the conclusion.

The linkage scores are essential because the arguments may be true. Still, they may not necessarily support the conclusion, even if they were true. For example, if someone posts the belief that the grass is green as a reason to support a conclusion, it needs to have a lower linkage score and a high truth score. On the other hand, if someone posts global warming as a reason to support a carbon tax, and the carbon tax is the best way to reduce global warming, this should strengthen the argument to conclusion linkage score.

```Graphql
# Step 1: Given a list of beliefs, allow them to be tagged as potential reasons to agree or disagree with each other.
# For each potential linkage, users can post reasons to support or oppose the linkage.
# These arguments will either be tagged as a "strengthener" or "weakener" of the conclusion.

# Let's assume we have a list of beliefs in the form of strings
beliefs = ["Belief A", "Belief B", "Belief C", "Belief D", "Belief E", "Belief F"]

# We can create a dictionary to store potential linkages as keys, and a list of arguments as values
potential_linkages = {"A_B": [], "A_D": [], "B_E": [], "C_F": []}

# For example, let's say we want to add an argument to support the linkage between Belief A and Belief B
potential_linkages["A_B"].append({"argument": "Belief A is supported by scientific evidence", "type": "strengthener"})

# Step 2: Assign a unique ID to each possible linkage.
# We can use the dictionary keys as unique IDs

# Step 3: Use the performance of these pro/con reasons to calculate the linkage strength.
# Specifically, calculate the strength of reasons to agree with the linkage, the strength of reasons to disagree with the linkage,
# and then the total strength of both arguments.

# Let's assume we have a function called calculate_argument_strength(argument) that takes an argument and returns its strength score.
# We can calculate the strength of reasons to agree and disagree for each potential linkage like this:

for linkage, arguments in potential_linkages.items():
    total_strength = 0
    agree_strength = 0
    disagree_strength = 0
    
    for argument in arguments:
        strength = calculate_argument_strength(argument["argument"])
        total_strength += strength
        
        if argument["type"] == "strengthener":
            agree_strength += strength
        elif argument["type"] == "weakener":
            disagree_strength += strength
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the Evidence to Conclusion Linkage Score (ECLS) using the formula:
    # ECLS(A, B) = (Σ strength of reasons to agree with the linkage between A and B) / (Σ total strength of arguments, agree and disagree).
    # Store the ECLS in a table for each argument.
    ecls = agree_strength / total_strength
    
    # We can store the ECLS for each linkage in a dictionary
    linkage_ecls[linkage] = ecls
    
# Step 5: Multiply each argument's score by its corresponding ECLS to determine its contribution to the total conclusion score.
# Step 6: Sum the scores for all arguments supporting or opposing the conclusion to determine the final conclusion score.
# Let's assume we have a function called calculate_belief_score(belief, linkages) that takes a belief and a dictionary of ECLS values,
# and returns its score as a weighted sum of the ECLS values for all of its supporting or weakening linkages.

# We can calculate the score for each belief like this:
belief_scores = {}
for belief in beliefs:
    score = calculate_belief_score(belief, linkage_ecls)
    belief_scores[belief] = score
    
# The final conclusion score is the product of each supporting and weakening belief score, multiplied by their individual scores as valid reasons to support the conclusion.
# Let's assume we have a list of supporting and weakening beliefs for the conclusion
supporting_beliefs = ["Belief A", "Belief B"]

```

Initially, determined by semantic similarity metrics and machine learning algorithms, this score is also subjected to our pro/con argument evaluation process. Specific to equivalency, users can submit and vote on reasons why beliefs are similar or superior to the other. We track the performance of these arguments and related up/down votes (or other measures of user approval) to increase confidence in the equivalency score, similar to how stock prices are tracked over time.

The Equivalency score is a metric used on a debate platform to determine the degree of similarity or overlap between two arguments. It is initially generated by combining semantic similarity metrics and machine learning algorithms, which compare the language and structure of the arguments. This initial score is called the Computer-generated Equivalency Score (CES).

Users can also submit and vote on pro/con reasons that argue two statements are essentially saying the same thing, which can adjust the Equivalency score over time. This user-generated score is called the User-generated Equivalency Score (UES).

The final Equivalency score is calculated by combining the CES and the UES, with the weighting of each determined by the performance of the Validity Comparison Argument (VCA). The VCA is an argument that evaluates whether the CES or the UES is better at identifying equivalency between two arguments.

The VCA is essentially an argument for the relative merits of the CES and the UES. It will evaluate the performance of each score and determine the multiplier for the CES. The multiplier for the CES will be the percentage of agreement in the VCA that the CES is more reliable and accurate than the UES.

In mathematical terms, the Equivalency score (ES) between two arguments A and B can be expressed as follows:

ES(A,B) = w_ces * CES(A,B) + w_ues * UES(A,B)
where w_ces and w_ues are the multipliers for the CES and UES, respectively, and are determined by the VCA. The CES and UES are calculated using semantic similarity metrics and machine learning algorithms, as well as user-generated pro/con reasons.

### Semantic Similarity Metric (SSM)
We'll use the spacy library to generate document vectors and calculate the cosine similarity between them.

```python
import spacy

# Load the English language model in spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_md")

def ssm_score(statement1, statement2):
    """
    Calculates the semantic similarity score between two statements using cosine similarity
    """
    doc1 = nlp(statement1)
    doc2 = nlp(statement2)
    
    return doc1.similarity(doc2)
```

### Equivalency Score Calculation
This algorithm combines the SSM score and user-generated scores to calculate an overall Equivalency score.
```python
def equivalency_score(statement1, statement2, user_scores):
    """
    Calculates the Equivalency score between two statements
    """
    # Calculate the SSM score between the two statements
    ssm = ssm_score(statement1, statement2)
    
    # Calculate the user-generated score (if any)
    if user_scores:
        user_score = sum(user_scores) / len(user_scores)
    else:
        user_score = 0
    
    # Calculate the overall Equivalency score, weighting each score by the Validity Comparison Argument (VCA) multiplier
    vca_multiplier = 0.8 # example value, can be adjusted based on performance of VCA argument
    equivalency_score = (ssm * (1 - vca_multiplier)) + (user_score * vca_multiplier)
    
    return equivalency_score
```
