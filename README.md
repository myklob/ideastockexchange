# Idea Stock Exchange: Automating Conflict Resolution and Cost-Benefit Analysis

The Conclusion Score (CS) in the context of the Idea Stock Exchange and its automated conflict resolution system is a metric designed to quantitatively assess the strength and validity of a particular conclusion or belief. This score is derived from a comprehensive evaluation process that considers various aspects of the arguments and evidence supporting or opposing the conclusion. Here's a breakdown of its components based on the information from your documents:

**Reasons to Agree/Disagree (RtA/RtD):** These metrics quantify the persuasive power of arguments in favor of or against a conclusion. They include the number and strength of such arguments.

**Evidence Assessment (EA/ED):** This involves evaluating the solidity and relevance of evidence that reinforces or detracts from an argument. It considers the quality and directness of the evidence in relation to the conclusion.

**Logical Validity (LV):** This aspect assesses whether an argument is logically coherent and free from fallacies. It is determined through debate outcomes and user responses, specifically focusing on identifying and accounting for any logical fallacies.

**Verification (V):** indicates how impartial and independent sources corroborate evidence. The score for verification is derived from how well each argument’s evidence is verified and supported.

**Linkage (L):** This multiplier assesses the direct connection and impact of the argument on the conclusion based on how relevant and integral the argument is to the decision.

**Uniqueness (U):** This recognizes the distinctiveness of arguments, rewarding originality and reducing redundancy. It involves identifying similar statements and determining a unique argument score when presented in support of the same conclusion.

**Importance (I):** This measures the significance of the argument and the potential ramifications if the claim is assumed true. The weight of an argument in terms of its importance is determined through debate over its relative importance.

The Conclusion Score (CS) is calculated using the formula:
# CS=∑((RtA−RtD)×(EA−ED)×LV×V×L×U×I)

Each element is critical in determining a conclusion's overall strength and credibility. The scoring system is designed to be objective and comprehensive. It incorporates many factors to evaluate conclusions based on the strength and quality of their supporting and opposing arguments and evidence​​.

Each item uses ReasonRank to create a score based on the performance of pro/con sub-arguments. Of course, these sub-arguments also have their own reason rank score. 


# Objective Debate Evaluation System (ODES)

## Overview
Objective Debate Evaluation System (ODES) is an innovative scoring formula designed to transform the way debates are evaluated. By quantitatively assessing the strength of evidence and its linkage to debate conclusions, ODES introduces a new level of objectivity and precision in debate analysis.

## Features
- **Objective Scoring Formula**: Calculates the Conclusion Score (CS) based on logical, evidence-backed metrics.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation Criteria**: Factors in reasons to agree/disagree, evidence strength, logical validity, verification, linkage, uniqueness, and importance.
- **ReasonRank Algorithm**: An adaptation of the Google PageRank algorithm, tailored for debate scoring, to rank and weigh arguments effectively.

Conclusion Score (CS) = ∑ (Reasons to Agree (RtA) - Reasons to Disagree (RtD)) × (Evidence Assessment for Agreement (EA) - Evidence Assessment for Disagreement (ED)) × Logical Validity (LV) × Verification (V) × Linkage (L) × Uniqueness (U) × Importance (I)

This formula encapsulates:

* CS (Conclusion Score): The final score assigned to a conclusion.
* RtA/RtD: The balance of arguments supporting or opposing the conclusion.
* EA/ED: The quality of evidence for or against the conclusion.
* LV: The logical consistency of the conclusion.
* V: The degree to which the conclusion has been confirmed.
* L: How strongly the conclusion is connected to other relevant conclusions.
* U: The distinctiveness of the conclusion from similar arguments.
* I: The overall significance of the conclusion in a broader context.

## Getting Started
