## We should promote conclusions that have more valid reasons to agree with them that reasons to disagree with the conclusion ##

Assuming we have an algorithm that does a pretty good job at giving arguments scores, then if you have more good arguments that agree with a conclusion than bad ones, you can say that that conclusions is, for the purposes of discussion, a better idea than a conclusion that has more good reasons to disagree with it than good reasons to agree with it.

If we have an algorithm that is able to rank reasons to agree with a conclusion by how valid the reason is then those conclusions with more valid reasons to agree with them should be considered more valid.
