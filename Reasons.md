### We should create a forum that allows people to brainstorms reasons to agree and disagree with important conclusions ###
[Reasons](Reasons.md) to agree:
  1. It would be cool to have [reasons to agree and disagree on the same page](reasonstoagreeanddisagreeonthesamepage.md).
  1. Why not? It hasn't been done before. No one has created a forum that has one page per thesis, and allows users to submit reasons to agree and disagree in a structured format.
  1. It couldn't be worse than current online discussion boards.

### Argument evaluation ###

The software we create will have a thesis at the top of page with a column for reasons to agree with the conclusion and a column for reasons to disagree with the conclusion. The reasons are logical arguments, and when you click on any of them, it takes you to another page, where that argument has become the thesis, with reasons to agree and disagree with it.

You can submit a reason to disagree with an argument by saying that it is one of the following logical fallacies:
  1. Fallacy of Accident or [Sweeping Generalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_(fallacy))
  1. [Converse Fallacy of Accident or Hasty Generalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_accident)
  1. [Irrelevant Conclusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoratio_elenchi)
  1. [Affirming the Consequent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent)
  1. [Denying the antecedent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denying_the_antecedent)
  1. [Begging the question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question)
  1. [Fallacy of False Cause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_(logic))
  1. [Fallacy of many questions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_many_questions)
  1. [Straw man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)

When you assert that an argument follows a logical fallacy, then you are making another argument. Of course this will lead to a whole new list of reasons to agree and disagree, with the percentage of people who agree with you, etc.

When you tag an argument as a logical fallacy, you post your arguments, but people don't agree with you, it will not harm the original argument.
### We should create algorithms that promotes good reasons ###

#### People evaluating each reason ####

I imagine people would want to rate an idea, on a scale from 1 to 10, on the following criteria:
# Are statistics sited to a verifiable source?
# Does the Reason support the conclusion?
# Is the reasons clearly stated?
# Is the reason stated briefly?
# On a scale from 1 to 10 how much do you believe that the argument uses the following logical fallacy:

But you say, "people are biased, we can't trust them to evaluate the logic of an argument when they might have a vested interests". I would concede your point, and walk away from this whole thing, if perfection is the standard by which we measure this sites success. However I am going to evaluate this site, by weather or not it will be better than any other site, and I believe it will be. Also we can encourage people to try to set aside their biases.

Some ways we can encourage people to set aside their bias is to weaken the strength of people's votes who always use a 1 or 10 to evaluate someone else's logic. We should also let people vote if they agree or disagree with an argument or not. If you disagree with a conclusion, and also consistently give low scores to every reason to support the conclusion, then you are not thinking, because every controversial topic has at least some valid reasons to agree and disagree with it.

So if you disagree with a conclusion, you will be asked to evaluate the top reasons to support the conclusion. If you do this in a way that indicates that you are actually considering each reason, then you will be rewarded.

## Scoring and evaluating reasons to agree and disagree ##

A major feature of this project is to design algorithms that give scores to reasons to agree and disagree with a thesis. Once these reasons have a score, they can lend their support to support or oppose many different conclusions.

Homer Simpson said; "Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true. Facts Schmacts".

However facts are not meaningless. Facts are Facts. We don't believe conclusions can be proven, because no one has ever gathered all the reasons to agree and disagree with a particular conclusion and investigated them all. We also don't believe truth can be evaluated because so many people who claim to have truth contradict each other, and seem so stupid. Vilhjalmur Stefansson said, "The most striking contradiction of our civilization is the fundamental reverence for truth which we profess and the thorough-going disregard for it which we practice."

I'm not saying we can find truth, but we can find that some things are more likely to be true than others, based on an investigation of the evidence that people are able to present as reasons to believe that something is true or not.

And so what I am proposing is that we gather all the reasons to agree and disagree with a conclusion, and then set it up so that you click on any of those reasons, and you can see reasons to agree and disagree with it. And this keeps going until you have given each reason a score, and you add up all the scores for the top conclusion.

We all assume that we can all walk around believing contradictory things, and that that s just the way things have to be. It doesn't have to be that way.

### How it would work ###
It will work a lot like the BCS algorithm in that it will use votes from real people and will also take into account data from comparing how ideas perform against each other in a competitive environment.

## Reasons to agree and disagree with reasons to agree and disagree(what?) ##

Much of the score assigned from the algorithm is dependent on how the webpage is laid out, so hang with me:

Every page will have a layout similar to this one:

Many reasons to agree with an conclusion are in and of themselves a new conclusion that needs to be debated. For instance "Obama is a socialist" might be Thesis#1. A reason to support this conclusion (RTA#1) might be "Obama supported the purchase of GM, which is a socialist act".

With this website, you will be able to click on RTA#1, and it will become its own thesis at the top of a page with its own list of reasons to agree and disagree with it.

With this setup you can see that a reason to agree with RTA#1 will ultimately lend support to Thesis#1.

With this format an algorithm could be set up very easily that counts the total number of reasons to agree with it, including reasons to agree with reasons to agree with it, and so on.

You say that this system could be "gamed". I honestly don't think so. Because if you put a bad reason to support an idea, thinking that you are helping by adding the number of reasons to agree, then that idea should have lots of reasons to DISAGREE with it, and those reason should have lots of reasons to agree with them, and so on.

I don't think I can explain it very well, but I have been thinking about this for about 10 years now, and I know it would work great.

#### Example ####

"The United States should not engage in Nation Building" is a conclusions, with many reasons to agree and disagree. However it can also be used as an argument that both Bush and Clinton used the military incorrectly. The belief will have a strength when it stands by itself. But it will have a different strength when used as an argument to support another conclusion. For instance in this case, perhaps the score given to the belief that we should not be involved in nation building gets a 79 out of 100. This score would then be multiplied by the score assigned to the belief that this is a valid reason to agree that Bush or Clinton misused the military. Obviously over time the percentage of people who believed that this applied to Clinton and Bush would very. Formal logicians have a specific format for this type of argument. They say there is one premise: we should not participate in nation building. The other premise is George Bush participated in nation building. If you participate in nation-building, you are misusing the military. Therefore George Bush misused the military.

Formal logic is required to make this site work, however I am not going to present the forum so as to say to our users that they have to use formal logic. The purpose of this website is to take the way that people argue naturally, organize it, quantify it, and evaluate it.

We should use the internet to [brainstorm reasons to agree and disagree](Brainstorm.md) with important conclusions

Reasons to agree:
  1. The search for truth involves a lot of information. If computers have good algorithms they can be very good at processing information. Putting data into columns as reasons to agree or disagree with a conclusion takes a very important step in processing data.
  1. Truth is important enough that we should work very hard to try and find it.
  1. It is important that citizens come to informed conclusions.

Thesis #1
| **Reasons to AGREE with Thesis #1** (RTAW#1)| **Reasons to DISAGREE with Thesis #1**(RTDW#1)|
