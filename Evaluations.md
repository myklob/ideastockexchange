# Images #
There are many ways to evaluate an image. Just do as we allays do: Let people post reasons to agree and disagree, and vote if an image makes a valid point in support of the conclusion.

# Assumptions evaluation #

The score of evaluating an assumption would represent how confident we are that the assumption really is necessary to come to a conclusion.

The score will start by taking into account people's votes.

We will enhance it by letting experts vote, and tracking their opinions. We can further enhance it by giving more weight to people who follow the rules of the forum, who consider the reasons to agree with a position and vote on the validity of these reasons before they vote against the idea, etc.

We can also let people bet with their reputation using fake game money, as to weather or not an assumption will raise in validity. The amount of money could they are willing to bet, could be taken into consideration when assigning the assumption validity score.

# Evaluate a person as a Reason to agree with a Thesis #

As you would expect there evaluation of the person, isn't just if you liked the person or not, but if the person can be said to support the conclusion or not.

However, just because someone who is very smart or informed supports or opposes a cause, doesn't mean that that cause is right or wrong.

The purpose of this algorithm is to, in the global war of ideas, identify how much of the water is being carried by a certain person, vs. a book, website, song, video, etc.

So the website would try to identify the person's expertise in the issue at hand, as well as how much the person suppered or opposed the conclusion being discussed. For instance Einstein should have gotten a high score in 1906 on the debate of if E=MC<sup>2 or not. He would also get a high score if Theses was trying to assert that E=MC</sup>2.

With this information, someone could identify the Person as making the largest case for a cause, and then they could focus their attention on proving the person wrong, if they are so inclined.

On the one hand you might assume that arguments from an expert should carry a lot of weight because, spend a lot more time thinking about these things than us. However there are many experts on both sides of an issue. There is no way to come to the truth of an issue, without taking all the arguments made in by people, and smashing them together, organizing them, categorizing them, removing duplication, finding the person who said things best, demoting bad logic, faulty assumptions, contradictions, and evaluating each assertion on their own merits.

Arguments from the person would have to be quoted and put into the reasons to agree and disagree, and categorized in order for real progress to be made, because this is the only way that we can merge the data from one person together with data from other persons.

But this does not change the fact that many people take experts as their reasons to believe something. For instance many people that because Einstein was, or was not, an atheist (depending on your point of view) that it should affect their beliefs.  It would be interesting to see the list of the top persons that support and oppose an issue, and further than that, which persons support and oppose specific aspects, and conclusions drawn about an issue.

We have to reflect the way people come to conclusions, before we can change the way people come to conclusions.

# Evaluate webpages submitted as a reason to agree or disagree #

As you would expect there evaluation of the web page, isn't just if you liked the web page or not, but if the web page can be said to support the conclusion or not.

However, just because someone makes a very good web page in support or opposition to a cause, doesn't mean that that cause is wrong.

The purpose of this algorithm is to, in the global war of ideas, to identify how much of the water is being carried by a certain web page, vs. a book, website, song, etc.

So another aspect of this algorithm would indicate how many web pages are sold, how much money is spent, or how many web pages are spent.

With this information, someone could identify the Web page as making the largest case for a cause, and then they could their attention on discrediting the web page, if they are so inclined.

On the one hand you might assume that arguments from a web page should carry a lot of weight because, the author would usually spend a lot of time with a subject, investigate it, and present his findings. However there are many authors on both sides of an issue who make web pages. There is no way to come to the truth of an issue, without taking all the arguments made in web pages, and smashing them together, organizing them, categorizing them, removing duplication, finding the person who said things best, demoting bad logic, faulty assumptions, contradictions, and evaluating each assertion on their own merits.

Arguments from the web page would have to be quoted and put into the reasons to agree and disagree, and categorized in order for real progress to be made, because this is the only way that we can merge the data from one web page together with data from other web pages.

But this does not change the fact that many people take web pages as their reasons to believe something. For instance many people believe 911Turth.com proves that there was a conspiracy to blow up the twin towers. It would be interesting to see the list of the top web pages that support and oppose an issue, and further than that, which web pages support and oppose specific aspects, and conclusions drawn about an issue.

We have to reflect the way people come to conclusions, before we can change the way people come to conclusions.

# Evaluate Videos Submitted As Reasons to agree or disagree with a conclusion #

As you would expect there evaluation of the video, isn't just if you liked the video or not, but if the video can be said to support the conclusion or not.

However, just because someone makes a very good video in support or opposition to a cause, doesn't mean that that cause is wrong.

The purpose of this algorithm is to, in the global war of ideas, to identify how much of the water is being carried by a certain video, vs. a book, website, song, etc.

So another aspect of this algorithm would indicate how many videos are sold, how much money is spent, or how many videos are spent.

With this information, someone could identify the Video as making the largest case for a cause, and then they could their attention on discrediting the video, if they are so inclined.

On the one hand you might assume that arguments from a video should carry a lot of weight because, the author would usually spend a lot of time with a subject, investigate it, and present his findings. However there are many authors on both sides of an issue who make videos. There is no way to come to the truth of an issue, without taking all the arguments made in videos, and smashing them together, organizing them, categorizing them, removing duplication, finding the person who said things best, demoting bad logic, faulty assumptions, contradictions, and evaluating each assertion on their own merits.

Arguments from the video would have to be quoted and put into the reasons to agree and disagree, and categorized in order for real progress to be made, because this is the only way that we can merge the data from one video together with data from other videos.

But this does not change the fact that many people take videos as their reasons to believe something. For instance many people believe the who killed the electric car proves that there was a conspiracy to stop electric cars. It would be interesting to see the list of the top videos that support and oppose an issue, and further than that, which videos support and oppose specific aspects, and conclusions drawn about an issue.

We have to reflect the way people come to conclusions, before we can change the way people come to conclusions.



# Evaluate a book as a Reason to agree with a Thesis #

As you would expect there evaluation of the book, isn't just if you liked the book or not, but if the book can be said to support the conclusion or not.

However, just because someone rights a very good book in support or opposition to a cause, doesn't mean that that cause is wrong.

The purpose of this algorithm is to, in the global war of ideas, to identify how much of the water is being carried by a certain book, vs. a movie, etc.

So another aspect of this algorithm would indicate how many books are sold.

With this information, someone could identify the Book as making the largest case for a cause, then they could their attention on discrediting the book.

On the one hand you might assume that arguments from a book should carry a lot of weight because, the author would usually spend a lot of time with a subject, investigate it, and present his findings. However their are many authors on both sides of an issue who right books. Their is no way to come to the truth of an issue, without taking all the arguments made in books, and smashing them together, organizing them, categorizing them, removing duplication, finding the person who said things best, demoting bad logic, faulty assumptions, contradictions, evaluating each assertion on their own merits.

Arguments from the book, would have to be quoted and put into the reasons to agree and disagree category, in order for real progress to be made, because this is the only way that we can merge the data from one book, together with data from other books.

But this does not change the fact that many people take books as their reasons to believe something. For instance many people believe the communist manifesto proves the advantages of communism. It would be interesting to see the list of the top books that support and appose communism, and further than that which books support and oppose specific aspects, and conclusions drawn about communism and any other topic.

We have to reflect the way people come to conclusions, before we can change the way people come to conclusions.

# Evaluate a reason to disagree #

When you submit a reason to disagree you are submitting a new Thesis: that the original thesis had one of the following logical fallacies:
  1. Fallacy of Accident or [Sweeping Generalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_(fallacy))
  1. [Converse Fallacy of Accident or Hasty Generalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_accident)
  1. [Irrelevant Conclusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoratio_elenchi)
  1. [Affirming the Consequent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent)
  1. [Denying the antecedent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denying_the_antecedent)
  1. [Begging the question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question)
  1. [Fallacy of False Cause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_(logic))
  1. [Fallacy of many questions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_many_questions)
  1. [Straw man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)

Once you do this people will be able to vote if they agree or disagree, post reasons to agree and disagree, etc.

So on a scale from (1% to 100%) how sure are you that the conclusion can be considered fitting a logical fallacy?


# Evaluate a Reason to agree or disagree #

In formal logic, a reason to agree is a premise. For instance in the following statement:
> "Since all men are mortal and Socrates is a man, it follows that Socrates is mortal"

There are two premises:
  1. All men are mortal
  1. Socrates is a man

So on a percent basis (from 1 to 100%) how much do you think that the conclusion follows from the premise?

The problem with the way debates happen now is no one talks to each other... they just talk about, and past each other. Putting each side of an argument on the same page is the only way to get each side together... it is logical... it is how our brain works... it just makes sense that you would have both sides on the same page, so you can compare the arguments from each side, to see which one you agree with... it just seems natural that you would read the reasons to agree and disagree, you could then evaluate the validity of each argument, perhaps giving each argument a score, and then giving the overall argument a score, indicating which side you are on... Each argument is its own thesis with reasons to agree and disagree with it, or at least reasons to agree or disagree that a fact can be used as a reason to support the overall idea... this is not argument about the fact itself, but an argument over the linkage of the fact as an argument to support an idea... so each assertion could be given a score for its own independent value, and then each belief could be given a score evaluating its validity as a reason to agree or disagree with another belief. For instance the belief that CO2 is released from the burning of fossil fuels is going to have a very high score. Their are a lot of very good arguments to support these beliefs, and each of these arguments can be verified by facts, that can be verified, and that you would damage your credibility in a site of rational people, if you tried discrediting... but this belief would have a different scores when used as a reason to support a carbon tax, or carbon credit program.

# Evaluate interest #

Interest have two components:
  1. The percent confidence you have that the interest can accurately be ascribed to the majority of those who agree or disagree
  1. The percent you would consider that a valid interest. For instance the desire for revenge is less valid than the desire to provide an honest living for your family. You say who are we to say that an interest is valid or not? Well we do it all the time. We say that your desire (interest) for neighbor's flat screen TV is not valid enough that it can over-ride your neighbors right to their property. It is better to get this debate out in the open and debate which interest are valid, instead of pretending that the law is going to let us all do whatever we want.
