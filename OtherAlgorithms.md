# Counting specific things as arguments to agree and disagree #

You have to count things to make them count.

People don't only use words to on webpages to make their arguments. They also write poems, songs, and make movies with agendas. It would be very useful to have all the best political cartoons that supported and opposed a specific conclusion on the same page. The same goes for books, videos, poems, and about any other things that has ever been used to make a an argument.

Each different type of object, should be tagged in a database as what it is. Different things can have different formulas for affecting the conclusion score.

To some degree, logic, reason, and the words of argument should be all we need to make our points. But photos of starving children, can perhaps carry more weight than words on a page. I like the main algorithm that counts arguments, and weighs arguments on their counts... but it would be interesting to contrast the weight given directly by people's arguments, and compare it to the "weight" that other items carry in making a point. For instance, someone might write an excellent book, that is very convincing that young women should avoid getting pregnant before graduating high school, but if TV shows make having a baby glamorous, and no one reads the book, you can loose the war. So perhaps you would try to represent the strength of these items in our society by the number of viewers who typically watch a TV show (Nielson's Raiting), have read a book (from Amazon sales records), or seen a movie.

## Images as Reasons to Agree and disagree ##

### We should tag images as reasons to agree or disagree with a conclusion ###

We should keep track of the best images that are used to make a point. Many people from all cultures have a saying like, “Images can say a thousand words.” This is because a complex idea can be conveyed with just a single still image. These images take many different forms, such as political cartoons, and even graphics such as charts, and bar graphs.
Once images are tagged as reasons to agree or disagree with a conclusion, we should display them in separate columns on a webpage devoted to analyzing the validity of that conclusion.

We should gather these images together on the same page, tag them to identify which side of the debate they take, so we can put them in the right column, and try to move more persuasive images, to the top of their lists.

I believe we can design online forums that promote good debate. In order to have a good debate we need to bring all the stuff that supports a belief and that opposes a belief together to the same page. No one seems to understand that It doesn't prove anything if you make a good argument, but ignore those that disagree with you.


People try to use graphs, tables, and political cartoons to come to the opposite conclusions. We should gather these images together on the same page, tag them to identify which side of the debate they take, so we can put them in the right column, and try to move more persuasive images, to the top of their lists.

I think if we tracked the number and quality of images that are suggested as reasons to agree or disagree with a conclusion we could come up with algorithms that use this data to promote beliefs that have been more thoroughly examined, and supported.

Having images that agree and disagree with a conclusion on the same page will result in a better informed reader, which will result in this web forum’s users having the ability to make better informed decisions.


### How Would it Work? ###

People will propose that an image be used as a reason to support or oppose a conclusion. Each image will get its own page, a quality rank, and a linkage quality rank. On its page, people will be able to submit reasons to agree or disagree with an image. Images that are used as reasons to support or oppose different conclusions, such as political cartoons, will have many reasons to agree and disagree the linkage. We will allow users to put these on the same page, in separate columns, and organize them with the best ones at the top of the page.

Many factors will be used to rank each image. One factor that will affect the score for a reason, is the number and score of reasons to agree or disagree with them. Did you catch that? Each reason will have reasons to agree and disagree with them, just like in normal life. Because each argument, in real life is its own conclusion. For instance each reason to agree or disagree that someone is a good president will have many reasons to agree or disagree with them, and so on.

Of course we will also allow users to rate arguments. But more than just a thumbs up or a thumbs down we will allow users to evaluate specific aspects of an arguments: is an argument fair, accurate, does it exhibit any of the specific logical fallacies such as a straw man argument?

All these factors will result in a score for each argument. However arguments are used to support or oppose many specific conclusions. For instance the belief that it was wrong for Germany to invade Poland, can be used to support different arguments, with different levels of validity.

Each reasons to agree or disagree submittal would include the belief that it supports or opposes a specific conclusion. You would click on a link to argue in support or opposition to each relationship.

On this website most of my reasons will be submitted to support non controversial topics surrounding family life.

Visit one of my other pages to see how videos can be used to support or oppose different conclusions.


This is the best equation I can come up with for adding points to a belief based on the number of and the quality of images that are suggested as a reason to support or disagree with a conclusion.

I would love your feedback!

Below is an explanation of each term.

  * IAn/IDn = Images that have been said to support or oppose the given conclusion
  * IS = Image Score. Image scores take into account the score of the belief that something is a high quality image. This score is similar to every other argument, and has a score based on all the algorithms described in the Idea Stock Exchange.
  * Ln = Book link score. You can have a good book, that doesn’t actually support the proposed belief. Each argument that a book supports a belief, becomes its own argument that that its own book “linkage score” that is given points according to the above formula

## Counting Money Invested in and against the belief ##
**Put your money where your BRAIN is: how money could be used to help weigh the validity of a belief**

This function will add points to conclusions that have money invested in them or their supporting arguments, and subtract points from conclusions that tend to have money invested against them.

Why do this? Because Vegas understands the relative strength of football team. Wall Street understands the relative strength of each company, and Intrade will tell you which president will win. Why don't we use “markets” to tell us the relative strength of each argument, before we make life or death decision in the Middle East?  Why do we have more processing power dedicated to analyzing football games than we do life or death problems?

Below is an explanation of the terms in my equation. I would love input!

### My Good Idea Promoting based on money invested equation in words: ###
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wz3CuQFciSI/UMtRAjczyII/AAAAAAAAmjw/IwOD3AROVfg/s640/Put+your+money+where+your+BRAIN+is+how+money+could+be+used+to+help+weigh+the+validity+of+a+belief.JPG

### My Good Idea Promoting based on money invested equation in math: ###
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-774XINgZxUU/UMjQ1WAnwDI/AAAAAAAAmfY/mqMD-lqehO4/s1600/Money.GIF

  * Man/n: When n is 1, this equation will add all the money invested in a belief. When n is equal to 2 it will take the money invested in arguments that support the belief, divides it by 2, adds that to the conclusion score. Money invested in a belief, +1/2 the money invested in beliefs that agree with this belief, etc – Money invested against this belief, -1/2 the money invested in beliefs that disagree with this belief, etc
  * Mdn/n: This equation does the same as above but subtracts the total amount of money invested in arguments that disagree with it.
  * TM = Total Money invested in the forum
  * #B = number of beliefs

The average amount of money invested in an idea = TM / #B. The goal of this idea is to assign 1 point for the average belief, and 2 points for a belief that has twice the average amount of money invested.

The assumption is that people would be able to purchase “stock” in a belief at its idea score. They would purchase it assuming that the idea score was going to go up. We would have to set the transaction fee high enough, to ensure that we don’t lose money, and only smart people are making money. We would also only sell stock in relatively stable ideas.

### The code for an application of my Money equation in SQL: ###
Please help me build the open source SQL code that can do the following:
  * Count the amount of money invested in a belief or an argument. This will be a string of text stored in a "varchar" field.
  * As outlined above, the SQL database will have arguments that are submitted as reasons to support conclusions. These will have a n=1 relationship. When argument "C"  is used to support another argument "B", that supports conclusion "A", then "A" and "C" have an n=2 relationship. I think our conclusion score should take 1/2 of the money that supports C and give that amount as points to A.

As soon as I learn SQL I should be able to define the requirements better. Until then I hope to find a few programmers willing to help outline the process. Please consider helping!

### Your equation ###
Do you have a better equation that would use people's aversion to part with their money, that would promote good arguments, and beliefs? Leave a comment, or a link, and I will link to your project. I don't need the credit, I just don't want to live in a world of non-structured beliefs, and conclusions that people don't even try to support in an intelligent manor. Is money the answer? No, but it could help people try to really evaluate the true strength of a conclusion, if they felt that that conclusion would go up in value based on its truth strength... Do you disagree? Leave a comment.

## Counting the number of laws that can be said to support or oppose different conclusions, and using this data to quantifiable indicate how wrong each society feels each activity is, and potentially using this data as a way to add weight to conclusions that some things are wrong ##

Laws are conclusions societies have already made, that certain actions are wrong. Lets count them, and weigh them in an organized computer sciency way, that represents what we as a society already believe, and how strongly. Because we can't fix what we believe, until we understand it. We can't count something we don't count, measure, or evaluate.

I believe that we can count the number of laws that agree or disagree with a belief, as a way of measuring how much  society believes something is wrong.

For example every society believes that murder is wrong, and often punishes it with some sort of criminal justice program.

A way of quantifying this so that you can give scores to conclusions based on the quantity of laws that are said to support a belief (like murder is bad) and the quality of arguments that a law supports a certain belief about a behavior being bad, the relationship score between the belief and the law, the severity of punishment for breaking the law, and the relative number of laws that can be said to agree or disagree with the belief, or any of the supporting arguments, would be to make an equation and build it in software.

A way of counting all of this with a powerful algorithm could be expressed this way:
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KK0Qx-wrV8U/UM35u1F89hI/AAAAAAAAmpE/A0Na55HCKtE/s640/count+the+number+of+laws+that+agree+or+disagree+with+a+belief,+as+a+way+of+measuring+how+much+each+society+believes+something+is+wrong.JPG

Or we could represent the math more simply by substituting algebra, with the following definitions:

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fd0T8eQ2Fvk/UM36CiJLKJI/AAAAAAAAmpM/6WPJe7quVLM/s1600/count+the+number+of+laws+that+agree+or+disagree+with+a+belief,+as+a+way+of+measuring+how+much+each+society+believes+something+is+wrong2.JPG

Definitions:
  * LAn/LDn: Laws that are argued to agree or disagree or disagree with a conclusion
  * LAn+LDn::Number of laws submitted in this forum as reasons to agree or disagree with a conclusion. I’m just trying to find some way of normalizing this factor, or weigh it, so that it doesn’t carry too much or too little weight. Obviously, like any other factor on this forum, we could tweak multiplication factors, or allow users to tweak them.
  * LSn: Linkage Score: The linkage would become its own argument, with reasons to agree, and a score between -1 and 1. A negative score would be a law that actually makes a counter argument to the intended suggestion, 0 has no relation, and 1 fully supports the intended conclusion.
  * Psn: Punishment severity. For instance is the punishment a felony or a misdemeanor. How many years of prison are people typically punished.

### Examples: Is the Burqa so important that it should be required, or so bad it should be banned? ###

For example, the fact that almost all countries outlaw “murder of innocent adults” represents the amount of validity that most societies attribute to a belief. It may be rare that you would have laws that disagree and agree on non controversial topics. However, there are countries that ban and require women to wear Burqas. A way of measuring if mankind thinks it is wrong to wear the burqa would be to take the number of countries that ban them (France, etc) and subtract the number of countries that require them (Afghanistan, Saudia Arabia, etc).  Depending on what side of this is used to support, you would subtract or add the percentage of countries that ban it compared to the total number of countries that have laws on the use of an item.

### Examples: Is shooting an intruder a good activity that helps protect law followers, or is it a bad activity that ends a life too soon ###
Every time you lock the door it is to prevent intrusion. Millions of people in this country have guns, to protect themselves in the case of a violent intrusion. But is it wrong to shoot an intruder? Millions of people will talk about this during the 21st century. They will talk on the phone, in person, in e-mails, and in discussion forums. People will get upset, and have strong feeling on both sides. 99% of these conversations will be redundant. If someone makes a new point that has never been considered, or says something in a new way that makes the issue clear, it will be lost in the noise.

Many people buy guns without even knowing the laws regarding shooting an intruder. In a representative government, shouldn’t the people who get the law written (the voters) at least know what the laws are? No. Of course not. That is what lawyers are for. We should keep our laws hard to read, and hard to find, and defiantly keep them outside of any conversation about right and wrong.

Many people have debates about what should or should not be legal, without even knowing what our society has already decided, and written into law. I don’t know the laws, and I’m upset they are not organized into a clear way that shows how they are supported with clear logic.

People shouldn’t start this argument from scratch without even considering that perhaps someone else has thought long and hard about the issue. We should have a place on the internet where people have already worked out all the pros and cons, and we should have an algorithm that weights how much each society values the life of an intruder, and the safety of a gun owner.

## Administrators and Subject Area Experts ##

Until we have algorithms that can automatically promote better arguments (by rewarding good behaviors, punishing bad behaviors, and removing spam, and trolls) we may need administrators.

There are a number of ways of finding administrators. We could draw from the field of conflict resolution and dispute mediation. For instance we could offer training and give tests for skills that have been proven to resolve conflicts. There is a whole field of conflict resolution, which already has standards of training for good moderators.

For specific arguments, we could give slightly more weight to opinions by “certifiable experts” in that field. For each person who asserts they are an expert we could have an algorithm to determine how many extra points we would give their vote. I propose the following equation and list of definitions:

http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UCUppAjY2B8/UNC7kaJknzI/AAAAAAAAmpg/6-69ChAN4zA/s1600/Administrator.GIF


  * PR<sub>n</sub>:      Number of professors who remember or recommend a student.
  * PA<sub>n</sub>:      Number of professors who were asked to recommend a student. The database would have a form for sending a recommendation. It would have a list of known professors at a university that it would send the request to.
  * C:         Constant. This is needed because if you ask 1 teacher, and they recommend you, then we still are not 100% sure that you went to the school, or were a good student. The constant results in a situation where getting two of two recommendations would be better than getting 1 of 1, even though they are both 100%.
  * VES<sub>n</sub>:    Verifier’s expertise Score. A teacher’s level of expertise would be obtained by a similar equation, with their peers being the verifiers for each area of study.
  * RS<sub>n</sub>:      Recommender’s score. This multiple would allow teachers to weigh their recommendation, perhaps on a scale of 0 to 1.
  * RS<sub>n</sub> With a line over it:            This is the average score given out by a given teacher
  * SR<sub>n</sub>:      Number of fellow students who remember or recommend a student
  * SR<sub>n</sub>:      Number of fellow students who were asked to recommend a student. Similar to above, the database would have a form for sending a recommendation.
  * s<sub>n</sub>:        Score on a test designed to determine proficiency
  * S<sub>n</sub>bar:   Average
  * GPA:    Grade point average. Don't we need a 20 century solution to schools sending "official" transcripts? This is not the place for me to justify including every algorithm feature, and I don't want to start the debate of having online ways of proving your GPA, or weather it matters or not. Can we agree to disagree about the details, but agree that we need SOME way of promoting good stuff and demoting the crap.

### Subject Area Experts: Logic Professors ###
**Counting number of times Logic Professors have verified the logic of arguments that agree**


Introduction to Logic is a class taught at most universities. I am calling instructors of these classes logic professors. Logic professors live in the philosophy department. They know the only rational way to have an intelligent conversation about topics, but have never had a logical conversation themselves. This is because, the only way to really prove something is with the methods that they teach, but the methods they teach won’t work without putting arguments into relational databases that have all the if then relationships, and their validity built in.

There simply is not enough time for two people, without a relational database, to outline all the assumptions, and the if than statements that formal logic requires. When more than a few people try to use their methods, it becomes too chaotic, without the use of the internet to allow users to pick up the work, where others left off.

Individuals who understand formal logic, walk around with a smug realization of how stupid the rest of the world is for not using good logic, but they are themselves unable to ever see their dreams of a rational world fulfilled. Either they realize how complex it is and wish for a better system for outlining their methods, or they don’t understand how difficult it would be to actually implement their rules with a real debate, and just assume everyone else is too stupid to try it with.

We need more computer science students to take logic courses, and design forums that facilitate intelligent proofs of conclusions.

I had a logic professor, who was balding with a 3 foot pony tail. He was extremely short with a napoleon complex. It seemed like his knowledge of formal logic was compensating for something. Being right perhaps made up for not being liked  or accepted. I’m not over reading into this. He was a very smug angry little person.

We should build this forum, to help these people that know the world can be rational, but feel very lonely because the rest of us won’t join them. I’m not saying that they are all little wierdos. But it takes a very well adjusted person to see how stupid the world is, and to know simple rules the world all around them could use, if only they put forth the effort.

We don’t have to put forth the effort. We can build a relational database that uses all their little rules. They won’t be special or unique, because the power of their math will be universally appreciated when we start seeing the clarity of good logic, and how if than relationships can build to prove or disprove arguments. But they can just grow their pony tails a little longer, and teach other subjects in the philosophy department with a little more disdain.

I think if people limit themselves to very small portions of a debate. A very small assertion. If people continually work on stating that premis very susinctly, and stating the conclusions that they believe that premis supports, and are given time to explain, debate, and discuss if that premis actually supports that conclusion, and the best reasons to agree and disagree are organized into separate columns, and each reason to agree or disagree has reasons to agree or disagree with them, and we focus on each step, one at a time, our forum will continually improve. The world can eat an elephant one bight at a time, if millions of people are participating in a structured organized way, our forum would continually improve, just like Wikipedia. If people edited the relationships of arugments, and the best reasons to agree or disagree were all on the same page, and as assumptions were validated with other good assumptions, and the list of reasons to agree or disagree, and the reasons with high ratios of good reasons to support them moved up to the top of their list, and as people continually tweaked, edited, altered, and improved their wording, and their attempt to identify the causal relationships of their arguments, the debates would improved. But to make this process go faster, we should give people who understand formal logic a little more power to identify and tag bad logic, and verify valid logs.

We need people with expertise to initially identify the bad logic that when people attempt to use one premis as a reason to support another conclusion.

They know that we don’t use good logic to make our arguments. They know that our conclusions don’t usually follow from our assumptions. I wouldn’t give this little weirdo the power to run our country, but I think we should give people who can prove that they have taught introduction to logic courses at universities extra power on a website that is designed to reward good logic, an d punish bad logic.

I think if we tracked the number of logic professors that "certify" the logic of an argument and subtract the number of logic professors that "discount" the logic of an argument, we could use that data to promote ideas that have been more thoroughly examined, and supported.

This is the best equation I can come up with for adding points to a belief based on the number logic professors that support or oppose the logic used in an argument.

I would love your feedback!

Below is an explanation of each term.

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NQsHZFSoHOM/UMjMUfJIb7I/AAAAAAAAmew/iTjOCWRLk3Q/s1600/Logic.GIF

  * NPA = Number of Times a certified "logic" instructor from the philosophy department of an accredited university has verified/discounted the logic of a reason to disagree
  * Summing “ns” would mean that if a logic professor disagreed with a reasons to support your conclusion, that would take away ½ a point, because that action is twice removed.

If we give other experts extra weight in their area of expertise, than this website in general is the area of expertise of logic professors, conflict mediators, and lawyers (to some degree).

It is a logical fallacy to appeal to authority. However it can be an appropriate form of rational argument if all parties agree that the testimony is appropriate to the circumstances. For this reason it would be be interesting to analyze which so called experts agree or disagree with different beliefs.

### People Scores ###

Giving people scores based on their performance on this website is not a requirement. I think the overall equation is simple and powerful. It provides a way of giving conclusions scores based on the integrated ratio of reasons that agree vs. reasons that disagree. Counting tying conclusions together with their assumptions, and basing a conclusion’s score based on assumptions that are more than one linkage away will allow hundreds of different conclusions to be updated if they are all built on the same assumption. Just the fact that these relationships will be outlined will be powerful, but giving scores based on their relationship will be more powerful, and lead to more order, as the reasons with the highest ratio of agreement will move to the top of their lists when they are used as reason to agree or with other conclusions. All this being said, I asked myself what other methods could be used to promote better conclusions. I believe that even if an algorithm only slightly results in better conclusions being given better scores, that if small improvements are made 10 or 20 times, that us making 10 or 20% fewer stupid mistakes will have a powerful impact on the future of our species. However, I am afraid that explaining all these small improvements will be confusing, when the major code is not built yet. However, while I have them in my mind I want to outline them, get them out of my head, we can build the important ones first, and get these other ones done latter.

This website is built upon the premise that we can organize data in such a way, that we can promote good ideas, and demote bad ideas.

We will play with letting information related to those who agree or disagree with an idea affect the idea’s score. For instance, how many google search results come up with a given name? How many news stories? How many Google Scholar citations the person being cited?

In order for us to have any hope in mankind’s future, we have to believe that good ideas are recognized by smart people and carried forward throughout history. If this is true, smart people from the past will be remembered today. Plato, Aristotle, and Newton were all remembered because they said something true.

Algorithms are working today that rank scholars according to how often they are cited by their peers.

We will use similar techniques to promote ideas that are supported by many trained experts.

The ranking of users on how well they follow the rules, so that those who follow good dispute resolution techniques are rewarded.

  1. Rewarding those who support ideas before they are popular, once consensus has been achieved


  1. Arrogance. Are beliefs presented as facts.
  1. Respect. Is the poster letting his data do the talking, or are they trying to win by threatening or name calling.

Rewarding those who support ideas before they are popular, once consensus has been achieved


---

## Webpages as reasons to agree or disagree ##

Google assigns each website a score. We could use an algorithms that takes a webpages score (on a scale from 0 to 100%) and multiplies it by the percentage of agreement there is that that webpage supports an idea.

Obviously this would not be said to promote truth, just reflect in a usable way what "the internet" believes is worthy of linking to.

It is not a perfect way to promote an idea, but it is better than nothing and produce some interesting results.

I would love help from programmers who know how to get a website to implement an algorithm that gives a score to ideas based on the number of reasons there are that agree or disagree with the idea.

Ideas with lots of reasons to agree with it, and few reasons to disagree with it, would be considered strong. However each reason would also have a score based on the number of reasons that agree with it.

_Typical Format:_
**Thesis #1**
| **...that agree with Thesis #1**| **...that disagree with Thesis #1**|
|:--------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| 1. WTA#1|1. WTD#1|

  * Books
  * BA/D = Books that have been said to support or oppose the given conclusion
  * BS = Books Score
  * Books scores can take into account number of books that are sold, as well as the score given from book reviewers, etc
  * BLS = Book link score
  * You can have a good book, that doesn’t actually support the proposed belief. Each argument that a book supports a belief, becomes its own argument that that its own book “linkage score” that is given points according to the above formula

_"What we become depends on what we read after all of the professors have finished with us. The greatest university of all is a collection of books." ~ Thomas Carlyle_

We should allow users suggest books as reasons to agree or disagree with an idea. Now start thinking ahead what an algorithm could do, if someone says that a book agrees with their beliefs. Data is readily available from Amazon or E-bay or the New York Times best selling list of how well a book has sold.

So there would be three fields. One place where you submit the item that agrees or disagrees with the original idea. The second field would let you classify the object. Is it a book, awebsite, or simply a logical argument. The third field would be a place where the user explains why he thinks the book supports the conclusion that he/she has come to. Of course, people would be allowed to vote weather or not the book actually does support the side that the original user said that it would.

This is where the algorithm could get very sophisticated. Would you want to give more credibility to those who said they had actually read the book? Would you want to give even more credibility to those who had bought the book, as more proof that they actually read the book. Or how about people that used the website mediachest and could prove that they have the book, by the fact that they have let others use the book. What about people who wrote an essay on the book on the website. If Google was doing this, they could provide a place for users to write essays on books, similar to how Amazon lets users write essays. Perhaps they could not let people copy and paste essays into the form. It would only allow people to type their essays directly, to prevent stealing of essays. Perhaps people could vote on weather the book-essays were good or not similar to how Amazon lets users rate reviews, as to weather the review was "helpful" or not.

So, as an example, you could submit a best selling book as a reason to agree with an idea, and then right a thoroughly convincing explanation of why this book agrees with the idea, and an essay that proves that you understand the main points of the book.

If Google really wants to organize the worlds information, they must do this. We have plenty of books, we have plenty of content on the internet. We need ways of organizing this information into what it all means, and how all this information should affect us. The only good way information can affect us, is for it to help us make better decisions. In order for us to make better decisions, we must know all of the reasons to agree or disagree with a particular course of action. In order to do this, we should not start at ground zero, with only our own thoughts in our head. We should bring together all of the great thinkers from the ages from every corner of the planet, and organize all of their great thoughts, so that we can make the right decisions.

As you can see, this algorithm could be very simple, but it could also offer programmers hundreds of years of challenges to make it more sophisticated. I believe this is a strength of the idea, because it allows for continual improvement.

  * Other Stuff, like movies, songs, experts, etc
  * Similar to how I say books can support or oppose different conclusions, movies (often documentaries) can support or oppose different conclusions. Rotten tomatoes gives scores to movies. All of this data could be imported, as well as the formal logical arguments that a movie actually attempts to support or oppose a belief.


#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

A picture says a thousand words. Why would we keep them out of a debate? Why not have the top 10 pictures that support AND oppose the same issue.

Of course images are returned to Google based on an algorithm, images that have higher scores will contribute more power to the idea.

### Explanation of Video Algorithm ###

If pictures can say a thousand words, do some videos say even more?

A video of Tiananmen Square can be used to support many different conclusions: for instance that China was willing to do almost anything to maintain order, and power, that people want freedom.

Super-size Me, Food Inc, The Fog of War, and Who Killed the Electrical Car are all mass produced documentaries with a point. Many amateurs have made tens of thousands of similar YouTube type movies, but the content is all a mess. You may go to someone's website that has a lot of these videos, but I have never seen a website that dedicates a whole page to one issue, has a column for videos that support an idea, and another column for videos that appose an idea, and tries to use an algorithm to promote the best videos to the top of the page.












## Comparison to the Google Algorithm: ##
Google evaluates websites, and gives them a score. I would evaluate ideas and give them a score.

Google uses the number of links to a website, as a vote for how good that website is. I would use the number of reasons to agree with an idea as a vote for that idea, and the number of reasons to disagree with an idea as a vote against that idea.

Because not all web links are well thought out endorsements of a site's content, Google gives more weight to a link from a website that lots of people link to. Because not all reasons follow valid logic, I would assign more weight to a reason that has more reasons to agree with it (and fewer reasons to disagree with it), all the way back so the complete strength of the logic trees that are attempted to be used to support an idea, are evaluated, and represented by a continual refinement process.


Moto: "Facts are meaningless. You can use facts to prove anything that's remotely true. Facts schmacts" ~ Homer Simipson

We should build software that facilitates online forums with the following features and format (click on a link to see further explanation).

  1. [One thesis per page](OneBeliefPerPage.md)
  1. [Reasons to agree and disagree on the same page](Reasons.md)
  1. [The ability to evaluate reasons to agree and disagree](EvaluateRTA.md)
  1. [The ability to submit new content, such as reasons to agree or disagree](SubmitRTA.md)
  1. [Tracking interest of those who agree and disagree](Interest.md)
  1. [Algorithms that promote "better" conclusions according to the above list](PromotionOfGoodIdeas.md), as well as the going [price](Price.md) people are willing to invest in the belief that a conclusions score will improve (hence the Idea Stock Exchange). We will also include user feedback (votes) in our algorithm giving each conclusion and reason to agree or disagree its score (click on items from the list to see how I anticipate the algorithm could use that item to promote better conclusions). Items on the list with higher scores will be promoted to the top of each list. The top 10 ranked items will appear on the first page, so in the end you will have a page for each conclusion (or Thesis), organized by category, with the top 10 reasons to agree and disagree, interest of those who agree or disagree, including a separate spot for common and opposing interest, the top 10 books, webpages, videos, and people that agree and disagree.
  1. For each thesis their will be an ability to submit references to other places that say the same thing better, to eliminate duplication. As with everything when I say "better" there will be a percentage of people who agree that it says the same thing better, as well as a list of reasons to agree and disagree that it says the same thing better, etc.

# Algorithm factors #

The algorithm will try to reward those who are able to accurately predict the future. For instance if they consistently vote for ideas that gain in popularity.

The algorithm will promote those who use proper logic, follow the methods of conflict resolution, and are civil to other users.

The algorithm that is used to evaluate the strength of an idea will take into account the following data:

  1. The number of reasons to agree and disagree with an idea.
  1. The number or reasons to agree and disagree with reasons to agree or disagree with an idea. For instance, if the main idea is that we should elect Barack Obama, and you list "Obama has done a good job in Illinois" as a reason to support your belief, then any reason to support the belief that Obama has done a good job in Illinois will also help the belief that we should elect Obama as president. Similarly, any reason to disagree that Obama did a good job in Illinois, would also harm the belief the main belief. Basically you would have to let people vote weather or not the reason is relevant to the belief that other people are trying to use it as an argument to either support or oppose. You would multiply the idea score by the percent of people who think the idea is relevant.
  1. The number of people who agree or disagree with an idea. People will get scores based on other user's evaluation
  1. The number of [Webpages](Webpages.md) that are used as reasons to support or oppose an idea. People will vote weather or not they think the website really agrees or disagrees with the idea. 50% is the zero mark, and so if someone tries to list a website as an item that agrees with an idea, however people believe the website disagrees with the idea, then that website's strength will harm the idea.
  1. A very simple formula: Score = # of Reasons to agree - # of Reasons to disagree
  1. More complex: Score = (Reason to agree #1)**(#1's Score)... Where #1's score can be defined in a number of ways. But taken as the percentage of people who agree when asked that it is a valid point, would give you 1/2 a point for all the reasons that had 1/2 the people agree that it was valid, and a 3/4th a point for those reasons that 3/4th of the people think it is valid.**





















## We should give more points to conclusions that have higher perceived ethicality of their methods and results ##

It's important for people to decide how strongly they support these conclusions and to consistently apply these rules. Often people are very flexible with their logic. For instance they will say that the ends justify their means when it supports their conclusion, but they will reject this line of argument when it opposes this argument.

Computers can help us with this. People can give a score to a particular philosophical question, a computer could then run the math, and tell you, based on those assumptions, which conclusions are more valid. This can help people be consistent with their thinking, and find logical fallacies.

The idea score should give more points to conclusions that have a consensus that the means (methods used to obtain the result) are ethical

## There are mathematical ways we can give more points to conclusions that have higher perceived ethicality of their methods and results ##

For people who are good at math, this equation could be more formally represented with the fallowing equation and definitions.

http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jzeYAYyxfcg/UOG6zr_YQVI/AAAAAAAAmuk/sz1DmKHb6UE/s1600/Perceived%2BEthics%2BScore%2BMath-702751.JPG


Definitions
  * PES=Perceived Ethics Score: This can be added directly to the conclusion score, or we could use a multiplier on the ethics score, before adding the ethics score to the overall conclusion score.
  * Means
    * EMA (Ethical Means Asked) = The number of people who gave a score to the ethics of the means (or method) of a proposal.
    * EMEMA (Ethical Means): The score an individual gives a proposal for how ethical the means (or method) are (between 1 and 10).
    * C = A constant, such as 5, so that if 100% of a group of 50 people agree, than it will carry more weight
  * 10 = This is not required, and could be removed if we ask people to pick a number between 0 and 1. People may think this is weird, and so using 10 will help the math represent the average score being a number between 0 and 1, so that if the average score was 8, our equation would give us .8, or a validity of 80%.
  * Ends
    * EEA = The number of people who gave a score to the ethics of the ends (or results) of a proposal.
    * EEEEA (Ethical Ends): The score an individual gives a proposal for how ethical the ends (or results) are (between 1 and 10).
    * EMA (Ethical Means Asked) = The number of people who gave a score to the ethics of the means (or method) of a proposal.
    * 10 = See above
    * EEJ (Ethical Ends Justify):  The percentage of people who think that the ends (goals) justify the means (methods)

## There are mathematical ways we can give more points to conclusions that have more reasons to believe they have ethical methods and results ##

I propose the basic Ethics Method score outlined below:

http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DNQ2Tsb-OyQ/UOG60ERFNRI/AAAAAAAAmu0/KY3uRo7TbyI/s1600/Simple%2Bethics%2Bmethods%2Bargument%2Bcounting%2Bscore-704624.JPG

However, once this is working, we could tweak it a bit. It may be slightly more complicated, but I believe will give us better results.

Many beliefs have explicit actions. For instance, Barack Obama proposed that "we raise taxes for families who make more than $250,000 a year". This statement is a single action proposal. However, a single action can have many related ethical arguments.  For instance we can investigate the broader ethical question of a national income tax, or the ethics of a progressive national income tax, or the ethics of a specific national income tax that does not take into account cost of living, or family size.

Of course, if you familiarize yourself with my other equations, you will notice that I already count reasons to agree or disagree with each proposal. So for this item, we could just submit the argument about the ethics of a conclusion, as a standard argument. However, I see extra value of tagging an argument as a specific ethical argument that is related to either the method or the result.

Because an argument about the ethics of any of these sub-arguments, can also have arguments about their validity, we need to re-introduce the "Linkage score", and the use of n to represent the number of steps the sub-argument is away from the conclusion that we are currently giving a score:

  * n = number of "steps" the current arguments is removed from conclusion

We can use algebra to represent each term, and make it look a little more mathematical, with the below formula:

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fWCGzbSZYIo/UOG61uEyiQI/AAAAAAAAmvU/tjqsgKFZUwk/s1600/more%2Bcomplex%2Bethics%2Bmethods%2Bargument%2Bcounting%2Bscore%2Bmath-710237.JPG

  * n:                     Number of "steps" the current arguments is removed from conclusion
  * AAEMn,i)/n:                  Arguments that Agree that a proposal has Ethical Methods. When n=1 we are looking at arguments that are used directly to support the belief that a conclusion's methods are ethical. The 2nd subscript is "i". This is used to indicate that we total all the reasons to agree. So when n=1, we could have 5 "i's" indicating there are 5 reasons to agree. These would be labeled A(1,1), A(1,2), A(1,3), A(1,4), and A(1,5). N on the bottom indicates that reasons to agree with reasons to agree only contribute ½ a point to the overall conclusion. Thus reasons to agree with reasons to agree with reasons to agree would only contribute 1/3 of a point, and so on.
  * ADEM(n,j)/n                  Arguments that Disagree that a proposal has Ethical Methods. Ds are reasons to disagree, and work the same as As but the number of reasons to disagree, are subtracted from the conclusion score. Therefore, if you have more reasons to disagree, you will have a negative score.  "J" is used, just to indicate that each reason to disagree is independent of a reason to agree.
  * The denominator is the total number of reasons to agree or disagree. This normalizes the equation, resulting the conclusion score (CS) representing the total percentage of reasons that agree. The conclusion score will range between -100% and 100% (or -1 and +1)

Many beliefs have explicit actions. For instance, Barack Obama proposed that we raise taxes for families who make more than $250,000 a year. This has unstated results. This may be somewhat complicated because people may disagree if a proposal really requires particular actions.

## There are computer programming ways we can give more points to conclusions that have higher perceived ethicality of their methods and results, or more reasons to believe they are ethical. ##

Most all equations can be implemented on computers. All we have to do is build a forum that collects the above data. Then it is a simple matter of applying the above equations.
